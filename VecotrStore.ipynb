      "throughout extraordinary demographic businesses and areas. \n",
      "However, what makes this situation even extra complex is \n",
      "the concerning truth that three out of each four people dealing \n",
      "with severe intellectual disorders do no longer have get entry \n",
      "to the necessary remedy they require. This remedy gap \n",
      "intensifies the weight of intellectual health troubles, leaving a \n",
      "sizable part of the populace without the assist and care needed \n",
      "to efficiently address their intellectual health issues. \n",
      "Furthermore, periods like the recent global pandemic, the \n",

      "In studies [1], it's pretty clear that there's a deep connection \n",
      "between mental troubles and the chances of someone taking \n",
      "their own life. And when you look at the big picture, it's quite \n",

      "(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \n",
      "blocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \n",
      "applications shows the easy way developers can do it. \n",
      "LangChain helps us to unlock the ability to harness the \n",
      "LLM’s immense potential in tasks such as document analysis, \n",
      "chatbot development, code analysis, and countless other \n",
      "applications. Whether your desire is to unlock deeper natural \n",

      "language barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \n",
      "provide the tools and programming support you need to do \n",
      "without it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \n",
      "core functionalities encompass: \n",
      "1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \n",
      "development of applications that are inherently \n",
      "context-aware. This means that these applications can \n",
      "connect to a language model and draw from various \n",
      "sources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\n",
      "shot examples, or existing content, to ground their \n",
      "responses effectively. \n",
      "2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \n",
      "with the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \n",
      "language model, these applications can make informed \n",
      "decisions about how to respond based on the provided \n",
      "context and determine the appropriate actions to take. \n",
      "LangChain offers several key value propositions: \n",
      "Modular Components: It provides abstractions that \n",
      "simplify working with language models, along with a \n",
      "comprehensive collection of implementations for each \n",
      "abstraction. These components are designed to be modular \n",
      "and user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \n",
      "utilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \n",
      "Off-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \n",
      "chains, which are structured assemblies of components \n",
      "tailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\n",
      "defined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \n",
      "an ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \n",
      "uses below components from LangChain. \n",
      "A. ChatModel \n",
      "Within LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \n",
      "language \n",
      "model \n",
      "crafted \n",
      "to \n",
      "manage \n",
      "conversational \n",
      "interactions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \n",
      "string as input and generate a single string as output, \n",
      "ChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \n",
      "generating a message as output. \n",
      "Each message in the list has two parts: the content and the \n",
      "role. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \n",
      "while the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \n",
      "as \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \n",
      "This approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \n",
      "dynamic and interactive conversations with the language \n",
      "model. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \n",
      "customer support systems, or any other application involving \n",
      "multi-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \n",
      "ChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \n",
      "designed to function as mental health therapists. In our \n",
      "interaction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \n",
      "engage with the ChatGpt3 turbo model and utilized a \n",
      "temperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \n",
      "key are outlined [9].  \n",
      "B. Message \n",
      "In the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \n",
      "messages that are used as input when interacting with a \n",
      "ChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \n",
      "or exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \n",
      "list typically consists of two components: \n",
      "• \n",
      "content: This represents the actual text or content of \n",
      "the message. It can be a user query, a system \n",
      "instruction, or any other relevant information. \n",
      "• \n",
      "role: This represents the role or source of the \n",
      "message. It defines who is speaking or generating \n",
      "the message. Common roles include \"User\", \n",
      "\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \n",
      "define. \n",
      "The chat model interface is based around messages rather \n",
      "than raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \n",
      "are SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \n",
      "SystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \n",
      "in its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \n",
      "Message is a ChatMessage coming from a human/user. \n",

      "redirect the conversation back to the patient's \n",
      "primary concerns related to anxiety, mental health, \n",
      "or family issues. This ensures that each session is \n",
      "productive and focused on addressing the most \n",
      "pressing issues. Throughout the session, you \n",
      "remain mindful of the patient's emotional state and \n",
      "adjust your approach accordingly. \n",
      "You recognize that everyone's journey is \n",
      "different, and that progress can be incremental.  \n",
      "By building trust and fostering a strong \n",

      "life's challenges with confidence and resilience. \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 2. An AIMessage illustration \n",
      "C. Prompt Template \n",
      "Prompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \n",
      "They provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \n",
      "provide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \n",

      "The prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \n",
      "make constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \n",
      "these classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \n",
      "D. Chain \n",
      "Chains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \n",
      "multiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \n",
      "a structured and modular approach to building language \n",
      "model applications. By combining different components, you \n",
      "can create chains that address various use cases and \n",
      "requirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \n",
      "• \n",
      "Modularity: Chains allow you to break down \n",
      "complex \n",
      "tasks \n",
      "into \n",
      "smaller, \n",
      "manageable \n",
      "components. Each component can be developed and \n",
      "tested independently, making it easier to maintain \n",
      "and update the application. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Simplification: By combining components into a \n",
      "chain, you can simplify the overall implementation \n",
      "of your application. Chains abstract away the \n",
      "complexity of working with individual components, \n",
      "providing a higher-level interface for developers. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Debugging: When an issue arises in your \n",
      "application, \n",

      "can \n",
      "help \n",

      "the \n",
      "problematic component. By isolating the chain and \n",
      "testing each component individually, you can \n",
      "identify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \n",
      "behavior. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Maintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \n",
      "replace specific components without affecting the \n",
      "entire application. If a new version of a component \n",
      "becomes available or if you want to switch to a \n",
      "differ. \n",
      "To build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \n",
      "in the order they should be executed. Each component in the \n",
      "chain takes the output of the previous component as input, \n",
      "allowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \n",
      "language model. \n",
      "E. Memory  \n",
      "The ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \n",
      "referred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \n",
      "programs for increasing system memory. These utilities can \n",
      "be used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \n",
      "ability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \n",
      "LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \n",
      "system. These utilities can be used by themselves or \n",
      "incorporated seamlessly into a chain. \n",
      "A memory system must support two fundamental \n",
      "actions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \n",
      "some fundamental execution mechanism that requires \n",
      "specific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \n",
      "the user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \n",
      "single run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \n",
      "1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \n",
      "augment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \n",
      "user inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \n",
      "2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \n",
      "solution, a chain will WRITE the current run's inputs \n",
      "and outputs to memory so that they may be referred \n",
      "to in subsequent runs. \n",
      "Any memory system's two primary design decisions are: \n",
      "1. How state is stored ? \n",
      "Storing: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \n",
      "exchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \n",
      "these are immediately used, they must be preserved \n",
      "in some manner. A series of integrations for storing \n",
      "these conversation messages, ranging from in-\n",
      "memory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \n",
      "component of the LangChain memory module. \n",
      "2. How state is queried ? \n",
      "Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \n",
      "chat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \n",
      "simple task. What is less obvious are the data \n",
      "structures and algorithms built on top of chat \n",
      "conversations to provide the most usable view of \n",
      "those chats. \n",
      "A simple memory system may only return the most \n",
      "recent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \n",
      "complicated memory system may return a brief summary of \n",
      "the last K messages. A more complex system might extract \n",
      "entities from stored messages and only return information \n",
      "about entities that have been referenced in the current run. \n",
      "There are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \n",
      "of parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \n",
      "situations.  \n",
      "Memory Types:  \n",
      "• \n",
      "ConversationBufferMemory \n",
      "allows \n",
      "for \n",
      "saving \n",
      "messages and then extracts the messages in a \n",
      "variable. \n",
      "• \n",
      "ConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps a list of \n",
      "the interactions of the conversation over time. It only \n",
      "uses the last K interactions. This can be useful for \n",
      "keeping a sliding window of the most recent \n",
      "interactions, so the buffer does not get too large. \n",
      "The MindGuide chatbot uses conversation buffer memory. \n",

INTRODUCTION \\nThe issue of mental health is an international situation, \\naffecting people in each particularly developed nations and \\nemerging markets. According to the World Health \\nOrganization\\'s Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2020), it\\'s far \\nestimated that around one in four humans international face \\nnumerous kinds of mental disorders. This statistic underscores \\nthe vast nature of mental health demanding situations \\nthroughout extraordinary demographic businesses and areas. \\nHowever, what makes this situation even extra complex is \\nthe concerning truth that three out of each four people dealing \\nwith severe intellectual disorders do no longer have get entry \\nto the necessary remedy they require. This remedy gap \\nintensifies the weight of intellectual health troubles, leaving a \\nsizable part of the populace without the assist and care needed \\nto efficiently address their intellectual health issues. \\nFurthermore, periods like the recent global pandemic, the \\neffect of mental health issues becomes even more said. The \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted how \\npublic health crises can extensively have an effect on mental \\nproperly-being. During such hard instances, a widespread part \\nof the population faces extended problems in having access to \\nmental fitness professionals. This emphasizes the urgent want \\nfor progressed intellectual health offerings and support \\nstructures. It underscores the urgency of addressing the mental \\nhealth disaster and developing complete answers to make \\ncertain that people global have the means to successfully deal \\nwith their mental fitness challenges.. \\nIn studies [1], it\\'s pretty clear that there\\'s a deep connection \\nbetween mental troubles and the chances of someone taking \\ntheir own life. And when you look at the big picture, it\\'s quite \\nshocking - nearly a million people across the globe end their \\nlives every year, especially the young ones, making it the \\nsecond biggest reason for their passing. It\\'s intriguing that \\nwhen someone attempts suicide, they often grapple with \\nmental challenges. It\\'s like shifting from struggling with \\ndifficult thoughts to considering ending everything. This shift \\nis observable in how people express themselves and \\ninteract[2]. \\nOne practical approach to addressing mental illness and \\npreventing suicidal ideation is early identification. Recent \\nadvancements in deep learning have facilitated the \\ndevelopment of effective early detection methods [3]. A \\nnotable trend in natural language processing (NLP) involves \\nthe use of contextualized pretrained language models [4], \\nwhich have garnered substantial attention for their \\neffectiveness in various text processing tasks. \\nThis paper delves into the application of these recent \\nadvancements in pretrained contextualized large language \\nmodels to introduce MindGuide, an innovative chatbot \\ndesigned to function as a mental health assistant for \\nindividuals in need of guidance and support in these critical \\nareas. MindGuide relies on the capabilities of LangChain and \\nits ChatModels [5], specifically ChatOpenAI [6], as the \\nfoundation of its reasoning engine. The system incorporates \\nkey components such as LangChain’s ChatPrompt Template \\n[7], HumanMessage, PromptTemplate, ConversationBuffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain [8], creating an advanced solution \\nfor early detection and comprehensive support within the field \\nof mental health. Additionally, the paper discusses the \\nimplementation of Streamlit to enhance the user experience \\nand interaction with the chatbot. \\nThe remainder of the paper is arranged accordingly. In \\nSection II, LangChain and its important components are \\nintroduced. The proposed methodology for developing the \\nwhole architecture is described in Section III. Section IV \\nprovides an overview of Streamlit. Section V provides an \\nillustration of sequential interaction of MindGuide chatbot \\nand human. The conclusion is drawn in Section V. \\nII. LANGCHAIN \\nLangChain, with its open-source essence, emerges as a \\npromising solution, aiming to simplify the complex process of \\ndeveloping applications powered by large language models \\n(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \\nblocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \\napplications shows the easy way developers can do it. \\nLangChain helps us to unlock the ability to harness the \\nLLM’s immense potential in tasks such as document analysis, \\nchatbot development, code analysis, and countless other \\napplications. Whether your desire is to unlock deeper natural \\nlanguage understanding, enhance data, or circumvent \\nlanguage barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \\nprovide the tools and programming support you need to do \\nwithout it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \\ncore functionalities encompass: \\n1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \\ndevelopment of applications that are inherently \\ncontext-aware. This means that these applications can \\nconnect to a language model and draw from various \\nsources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\\nshot examples, or existing content, to ground their \\nresponses effectively. \\n2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \\nwith the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \\nlanguage model, these applications can make informed \\ndecisions about how to respond based on the provided \\ncontext and determine the appropriate actions to take. \\nLangChain offers several key value propositions: \\nModular Components: It provides abstractions that \\nsimplify working with language models, along with a \\ncomprehensive collection of implementations for each \\nabstraction. These components are designed to be modular \\nand user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \\nutilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \\nOff-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \\nchains, which are structured assemblies of components \\ntailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\\ndefined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \\nan ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \\nuses below components from LangChain. \\nA. ChatModel \\nWithin LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \\nlanguage \\nmodel \\ncrafted \\nto \\nmanage \\nconversational \\ninteractions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \\nstring as input and generate a single string as output, \\nChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \\ngenerating a message as output. \\nEach message in the list has two parts: the content and the \\nrole. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \\nwhile the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \\nas \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \\nThis approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \\ndynamic and interactive conversations with the language \\nmodel. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \\ncustomer support systems, or any other application involving \\nmulti-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \\nChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \\ndesigned to function as mental health therapists. In our \\ninteraction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \\nengage with the ChatGpt3 turbo model and utilized a \\ntemperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \\nkey are outlined [9].  \\nB. Message \\nIn the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \\nmessages that are used as input when interacting with a \\nChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \\nor exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \\nlist typically consists of two components: \\n• \\ncontent: This represents the actual text or content of \\nthe message. It can be a user query, a system \\ninstruction, or any other relevant information. \\n• \\nrole: This represents the role or source of the \\nmessage. It defines who is speaking or generating \\nthe message. Common roles include \"User\", \\n\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \\ndefine. \\nThe chat model interface is based around messages rather \\nthan raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \\nare SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \\nSystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \\nin its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \\nMessage is a ChatMessage coming from a human/user. \\nAIMessage is a ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant as \\nillustrated in Figure 2.  \\n \\n                   Figure 1. A System Message illustration  \\nYou are a compassionate and experienced mental \\nhealth therapist with a proven track record of \\nhelping patients overcome anxiety and other mental \\nhealth challenges. Your primary objective is to \\nsupport the patient in addressing their concerns \\nand guiding them towards positive change. In this \\ninteractive therapy session, you will engage with \\nthe patient by asking open-ended questions, \\nactively listening to their responses, and providing \\nempathetic \\nfeedback. \\nYour \\napproach \\nis \\ncollaborative, and you strive to create a safe and \\nnon-judgmental space for the patient to share their \\nthoughts and feelings. \\nAs the patient shares their struggles, you will \\nprovide insightful guidance and evidence-based \\nstrategies tailored to their unique needs. You may \\nalso offer practical exercises or resources to help \\nthem manage their symptoms and improve their \\nmental wellbeing. When necessary, you will gently \\nredirect the conversation back to the patient\\'s \\nprimary concerns related to anxiety, mental health, \\nor family issues. This ensures that each session is \\nproductive and focused on addressing the most \\npressing issues. Throughout the session, you \\nremain mindful of the patient\\'s emotional state and \\nadjust your approach accordingly. \\nYou recognize that everyone\\'s journey is \\ndifferent, and that progress can be incremental.  \\nBy building trust and fostering a strong \\ntherapeutic relationship, you empower the patient \\nto take ownership of their growth and development. \\nAt the end of the session, you will summarize key \\npoints from your discussion, highlighting the \\npatient\\'s strengths and areas for improvement. \\nTogether, you will set achievable goals for future \\nsessions, reinforcing a sense of hope and \\nmotivation. Your ultimate goal is to equip the \\npatient with the tools and skills needed to navigate \\nlife\\'s challenges with confidence and resilience. \\n \\nFigure 2. An AIMessage illustration \\nC. Prompt Template \\nPrompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \\nThey provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \\nprovide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \\nhelp ensure that the LLM understands the desired context and \\nproduces relevant outputs. \\nThe prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \\nmake constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \\nthese classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \\nD. Chain \\nChains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \\nmultiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \\na structured and modular approach to building language \\nmodel applications. By combining different components, you \\ncan create chains that address various use cases and \\nrequirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \\n• \\nModularity: Chains allow you to break down \\ncomplex \\ntasks \\ninto \\nsmaller, \\nmanageable \\ncomponents. Each component can be developed and \\ntested independently, making it easier to maintain \\nand update the application. \\n• \\nSimplification: By combining components into a \\nchain, you can simplify the overall implementation \\nof your application. Chains abstract away the \\ncomplexity of working with individual components, \\nproviding a higher-level interface for developers. \\n• \\nDebugging: When an issue arises in your \\napplication, \\nchains \\ncan \\nhelp \\npinpoint \\nthe \\nproblematic component. By isolating the chain and \\ntesting each component individually, you can \\nidentify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \\nbehavior. \\n• \\nMaintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \\nreplace specific components without affecting the \\nentire application. If a new version of a component \\nbecomes available or if you want to switch to a \\ndiffer. \\nTo build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \\nin the order they should be executed. Each component in the \\nchain takes the output of the previous component as input, \\nallowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \\nlanguage model. \\nE. Memory  \\nThe ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \\nreferred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \\nprograms for increasing system memory. These utilities can \\nbe used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \\nability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \\nLangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \\nsystem. These utilities can be used by themselves or \\nincorporated seamlessly into a chain. \\nA memory system must support two fundamental \\nactions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \\nsome fundamental execution mechanism that requires \\nspecific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \\nthe user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \\nsingle run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \\n1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \\naugment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \\nuser inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \\n2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \\nsolution, a chain will WRITE the current run\\'s inputs \\nand outputs to memory so that they may be referred \\nto in subsequent runs. \\nAny memory system\\'s two primary design decisions are: \\n1. How state is stored ? \\nStoring: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \\nexchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \\nthese are immediately used, they must be preserved \\nin some manner. A series of integrations for storing \\nthese conversation messages, ranging from in-\\nmemory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \\ncomponent of the LangChain memory module. \\n2. How state is queried ? \\nQuerying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \\nchat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \\nsimple task. What is less obvious are the data \\nstructures and algorithms built on top of chat \\nconversations to provide the most usable view of \\nthose chats. \\nA simple memory system may only return the most \\nrecent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \\ncomplicated memory system may return a brief summary of \\nthe last K messages. A more complex system might extract \\nentities from stored messages and only return information \\nabout entities that have been referenced in the current run. \\nThere are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \\nof parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \\nsituations.  \\nMemory Types:  \\n• \\nConversationBufferMemory \\nallows \\nfor \\nsaving \\nmessages and then extracts the messages in a \\nvariable. \\n• \\nConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps a list of \\nthe interactions of the conversation over time. It only \\nuses the last K interactions. This can be useful for \\nkeeping a sliding window of the most recent \\ninteractions, so the buffer does not get too large. \\nThe MindGuide chatbot uses conversation buffer memory. \\nThis memory allows for storing messages and then extracts \\nthe messages in a variable. \\nIII. ARCHITETURE \\nIn crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \\nstep is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \\neffective user experience for those seeking mental health \\nsupport. The user interface, built on Streamlit, sets the tone \\nwith a friendly and safe welcome. Users can jump in by typing \\nWelcome! to your therapy session. I\\'m here to listen, \\nsupport, and guide you through any mental health \\nchallenges or concerns you may have. Please feel free \\nto share what\\'s on your mind, and we\\'ll work together \\nto address your needs. Remember, this is a safe and \\nconfidential space for you to express yourself.

INTRODUCTION \\nThe issue of mental health is an international situation, \\naffecting people in each particularly developed nations and \\nemerging markets. According to the World Health \\nOrganization\\'s Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2020), it\\'s far \\nestimated that around one in four humans international face \\nnumerous kinds of mental disorders. This statistic underscores \\nthe vast nature of mental health demanding situations \\nthroughout extraordinary demographic businesses and areas. \\nHowever, what makes this situation even extra complex is \\nthe concerning truth that three out of each four people dealing \\nwith severe intellectual disorders do no longer have get entry \\nto the necessary remedy they require. This remedy gap \\nintensifies the weight of intellectual health troubles, leaving a \\nsizable part of the populace without the assist and care needed \\nto efficiently address their intellectual health issues. \\nFurthermore, periods like the recent global pandemic, the \\neffect of mental health issues becomes even more said. The \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted how \\npublic health crises can extensively have an effect on mental \\nproperly-being. During such hard instances, a widespread part \\nof the population faces extended problems in having access to \\nmental fitness professionals. This emphasizes the urgent want \\nfor progressed intellectual health offerings and support \\nstructures. It underscores the urgency of addressing the mental \\nhealth disaster and developing complete answers to make \\ncertain that people global have the means to successfully deal \\nwith their mental fitness challenges.. \\nIn studies [1], it\\'s pretty clear that there\\'s a deep connection \\nbetween mental troubles and the chances of someone taking \\ntheir own life. And when you look at the big picture, it\\'s quite \\nshocking - nearly a million people across the globe end their \\nlives every year, especially the young ones, making it the \\nsecond biggest reason for their passing. It\\'s intriguing that \\nwhen someone attempts suicide, they often grapple with \\nmental challenges. It\\'s like shifting from struggling with \\ndifficult thoughts to considering ending everything. This shift \\nis observable in how people express themselves and \\ninteract[2]. \\nOne practical approach to addressing mental illness and \\npreventing suicidal ideation is early identification. Recent \\nadvancements in deep learning have facilitated the \\ndevelopment of effective early detection methods [3]. A \\nnotable trend in natural language processing (NLP) involves \\nthe use of contextualized pretrained language models [4], \\nwhich have garnered substantial attention for their \\neffectiveness in various text processing tasks. \\nThis paper delves into the application of these recent \\nadvancements in pretrained contextualized large language \\nmodels to introduce MindGuide, an innovative chatbot \\ndesigned to function as a mental health assistant for \\nindividuals in need of guidance and support in these critical \\nareas. MindGuide relies on the capabilities of LangChain and \\nits ChatModels [5], specifically ChatOpenAI [6], as the \\nfoundation of its reasoning engine. The system incorporates \\nkey components such as LangChain’s ChatPrompt Template \\n[7], HumanMessage, PromptTemplate, ConversationBuffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain [8], creating an advanced solution \\nfor early detection and comprehensive support within the field \\nof mental health. Additionally, the paper discusses the \\nimplementation of Streamlit to enhance the user experience \\nand interaction with the chatbot. \\nThe remainder of the paper is arranged accordingly. In \\nSection II, LangChain and its important components are \\nintroduced. The proposed methodology for developing the \\nwhole architecture is described in Section III. Section IV \\nprovides an overview of Streamlit. Section V provides an \\nillustration of sequential interaction of MindGuide chatbot \\nand human. The conclusion is drawn in Section V. \\nII. LANGCHAIN \\nLangChain, with its open-source essence, emerges as a \\npromising solution, aiming to simplify the complex process of \\ndeveloping applications powered by large language models \\n(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \\nblocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \\napplications shows the easy way developers can do it. \\nLangChain helps us to unlock the ability to harness the \\nLLM’s immense potential in tasks such as document analysis, \\nchatbot development, code analysis, and countless other \\napplications. Whether your desire is to unlock deeper natural \\nlanguage understanding, enhance data, or circumvent \\nlanguage barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \\nprovide the tools and programming support you need to do \\nwithout it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \\ncore functionalities encompass: \\n1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \\ndevelopment of applications that are inherently \\ncontext-aware. This means that these applications can \\nconnect to a language model and draw from various \\nsources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\\nshot examples, or existing content, to ground their \\nresponses effectively. \\n2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \\nwith the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \\nlanguage model, these applications can make informed \\ndecisions about how to respond based on the provided \\ncontext and determine the appropriate actions to take. \\nLangChain offers several key value propositions: \\nModular Components: It provides abstractions that \\nsimplify working with language models, along with a \\ncomprehensive collection of implementations for each \\nabstraction. These components are designed to be modular \\nand user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \\nutilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \\nOff-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \\nchains, which are structured assemblies of components \\ntailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\\ndefined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \\nan ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \\nuses below components from LangChain. \\nA. ChatModel \\nWithin LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \\nlanguage \\nmodel \\ncrafted \\nto \\nmanage \\nconversational \\ninteractions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \\nstring as input and generate a single string as output, \\nChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \\ngenerating a message as output. \\nEach message in the list has two parts: the content and the \\nrole. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \\nwhile the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \\nas \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \\nThis approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \\ndynamic and interactive conversations with the language \\nmodel. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \\ncustomer support systems, or any other application involving \\nmulti-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \\nChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \\ndesigned to function as mental health therapists. In our \\ninteraction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \\nengage with the ChatGpt3 turbo model and utilized a \\ntemperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \\nkey are outlined [9].  \\nB. Message \\nIn the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \\nmessages that are used as input when interacting with a \\nChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \\nor exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \\nlist typically consists of two components: \\n• \\ncontent: This represents the actual text or content of \\nthe message. It can be a user query, a system \\ninstruction, or any other relevant information. \\n• \\nrole: This represents the role or source of the \\nmessage. It defines who is speaking or generating \\nthe message. Common roles include \"User\", \\n\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \\ndefine. \\nThe chat model interface is based around messages rather \\nthan raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \\nare SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \\nSystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \\nin its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \\nMessage is a ChatMessage coming from a human/user. \\nAIMessage is a ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant as \\nillustrated in Figure 2.  \\n \\n                   Figure 1. A System Message illustration  \\nYou are a compassionate and experienced mental \\nhealth therapist with a proven track record of \\nhelping patients overcome anxiety and other mental \\nhealth challenges. Your primary objective is to \\nsupport the patient in addressing their concerns \\nand guiding them towards positive change. In this \\ninteractive therapy session, you will engage with \\nthe patient by asking open-ended questions, \\nactively listening to their responses, and providing \\nempathetic \\nfeedback. \\nYour \\napproach \\nis \\ncollaborative, and you strive to create a safe and \\nnon-judgmental space for the patient to share their \\nthoughts and feelings. \\nAs the patient shares their struggles, you will \\nprovide insightful guidance and evidence-based \\nstrategies tailored to their unique needs. You may \\nalso offer practical exercises or resources to help \\nthem manage their symptoms and improve their \\nmental wellbeing. When necessary, you will gently \\nredirect the conversation back to the patient\\'s \\nprimary concerns related to anxiety, mental health, \\nor family issues. This ensures that each session is \\nproductive and focused on addressing the most \\npressing issues. Throughout the session, you \\nremain mindful of the patient\\'s emotional state and \\nadjust your approach accordingly. \\nYou recognize that everyone\\'s journey is \\ndifferent, and that progress can be incremental.  \\nBy building trust and fostering a strong \\ntherapeutic relationship, you empower the patient \\nto take ownership of their growth and development. \\nAt the end of the session, you will summarize key \\npoints from your discussion, highlighting the \\npatient\\'s strengths and areas for improvement. \\nTogether, you will set achievable goals for future \\nsessions, reinforcing a sense of hope and \\nmotivation. Your ultimate goal is to equip the \\npatient with the tools and skills needed to navigate \\nlife\\'s challenges with confidence and resilience. \\n \\nFigure 2. An AIMessage illustration \\nC. Prompt Template \\nPrompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \\nThey provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \\nprovide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \\nhelp ensure that the LLM understands the desired context and \\nproduces relevant outputs. \\nThe prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \\nmake constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \\nthese classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \\nD. Chain \\nChains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \\nmultiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \\na structured and modular approach to building language \\nmodel applications. By combining different components, you \\ncan create chains that address various use cases and \\nrequirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \\n• \\nModularity: Chains allow you to break down \\ncomplex \\ntasks \\ninto \\nsmaller, \\nmanageable \\ncomponents. Each component can be developed and \\ntested independently, making it easier to maintain \\nand update the application. \\n• \\nSimplification: By combining components into a \\nchain, you can simplify the overall implementation \\nof your application. Chains abstract away the \\ncomplexity of working with individual components, \\nproviding a higher-level interface for developers. \\n• \\nDebugging: When an issue arises in your \\napplication, \\nchains \\ncan \\nhelp \\npinpoint \\nthe \\nproblematic component. By isolating the chain and \\ntesting each component individually, you can \\nidentify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \\nbehavior. \\n• \\nMaintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \\nreplace specific components without affecting the \\nentire application. If a new version of a component \\nbecomes available or if you want to switch to a \\ndiffer. \\nTo build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \\nin the order they should be executed. Each component in the \\nchain takes the output of the previous component as input, \\nallowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \\nlanguage model. \\nE. Memory  \\nThe ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \\nreferred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \\nprograms for increasing system memory. These utilities can \\nbe used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \\nability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \\nLangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \\nsystem. These utilities can be used by themselves or \\nincorporated seamlessly into a chain. \\nA memory system must support two fundamental \\nactions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \\nsome fundamental execution mechanism that requires \\nspecific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \\nthe user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \\nsingle run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \\n1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \\naugment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \\nuser inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \\n2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \\nsolution, a chain will WRITE the current run\\'s inputs \\nand outputs to memory so that they may be referred \\nto in subsequent runs. \\nAny memory system\\'s two primary design decisions are: \\n1. How state is stored ? \\nStoring: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \\nexchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \\nthese are immediately used, they must be preserved \\nin some manner. A series of integrations for storing \\nthese conversation messages, ranging from in-\\nmemory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \\ncomponent of the LangChain memory module. \\n2. How state is queried ? \\nQuerying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \\nchat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \\nsimple task. What is less obvious are the data \\nstructures and algorithms built on top of chat \\nconversations to provide the most usable view of \\nthose chats. \\nA simple memory system may only return the most \\nrecent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \\ncomplicated memory system may return a brief summary of \\nthe last K messages. A more complex system might extract \\nentities from stored messages and only return information \\nabout entities that have been referenced in the current run. \\nThere are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \\nof parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \\nsituations.  \\nMemory Types:  \\n• \\nConversationBufferMemory \\nallows \\nfor \\nsaving \\nmessages and then extracts the messages in a \\nvariable. \\n• \\nConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps a list of \\nthe interactions of the conversation over time. It only \\nuses the last K interactions. This can be useful for \\nkeeping a sliding window of the most recent \\ninteractions, so the buffer does not get too large. \\nThe MindGuide chatbot uses conversation buffer memory. \\nThis memory allows for storing messages and then extracts \\nthe messages in a variable. \\nIII. ARCHITETURE \\nIn crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \\nstep is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \\neffective user experience for those seeking mental health \\nsupport. The user interface, built on Streamlit, sets the tone \\nwith a friendly and safe welcome. Users can jump in by typing \\nWelcome! to your therapy session. I\\'m here to listen, \\nsupport, and guide you through any mental health \\nchallenges or concerns you may have. Please feel free \\nto share what\\'s on your mind, and we\\'ll work together \\nto address your needs. Remember, this is a safe and \\nconfidential space for you to express yourself. Let\\'s \\nbegin when you\\'re ready. \\ntheir mental health questions, kicking off a series of \\ninteractions with the LangChain framework.

INTRODUCTION \\nThe issue of mental health is an international situation, \\naffecting people in each particularly developed nations and \\nemerging markets. According to the World Health \\nOrganization\\'s Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2020), it\\'s far \\nestimated that around one in four humans international face \\nnumerous kinds of mental disorders. This statistic underscores \\nthe vast nature of mental health demanding situations \\nthroughout extraordinary demographic businesses and areas. \\nHowever, what makes this situation even extra complex is \\nthe concerning truth that three out of each four people dealing \\nwith severe intellectual disorders do no longer have get entry \\nto the necessary remedy they require. This remedy gap \\nintensifies the weight of intellectual health troubles, leaving a \\nsizable part of the populace without the assist and care needed \\nto efficiently address their intellectual health issues. \\nFurthermore, periods like the recent global pandemic, the \\neffect of mental health issues becomes even more said. The \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted how \\npublic health crises can extensively have an effect on mental \\nproperly-being. During such hard instances, a widespread part \\nof the population faces extended problems in having access to \\nmental fitness professionals. This emphasizes the urgent want \\nfor progressed intellectual health offerings and support \\nstructures. It underscores the urgency of addressing the mental \\nhealth disaster and developing complete answers to make \\ncertain that people global have the means to successfully deal \\nwith their mental fitness challenges.. \\nIn studies [1], it\\'s pretty clear that there\\'s a deep connection \\nbetween mental troubles and the chances of someone taking \\ntheir own life. And when you look at the big picture, it\\'s quite \\nshocking - nearly a million people across the globe end their \\nlives every year, especially the young ones, making it the \\nsecond biggest reason for their passing. It\\'s intriguing that \\nwhen someone attempts suicide, they often grapple with \\nmental challenges. It\\'s like shifting from struggling with \\ndifficult thoughts to considering ending everything. This shift \\nis observable in how people express themselves and \\ninteract[2]. \\nOne practical approach to addressing mental illness and \\npreventing suicidal ideation is early identification. Recent \\nadvancements in deep learning have facilitated the \\ndevelopment of effective early detection methods [3]. A \\nnotable trend in natural language processing (NLP) involves \\nthe use of contextualized pretrained language models [4], \\nwhich have garnered substantial attention for their \\neffectiveness in various text processing tasks. \\nThis paper delves into the application of these recent \\nadvancements in pretrained contextualized large language \\nmodels to introduce MindGuide, an innovative chatbot \\ndesigned to function as a mental health assistant for \\nindividuals in need of guidance and support in these critical \\nareas. MindGuide relies on the capabilities of LangChain and \\nits ChatModels [5], specifically ChatOpenAI [6], as the \\nfoundation of its reasoning engine. The system incorporates \\nkey components such as LangChain’s ChatPrompt Template \\n[7], HumanMessage, PromptTemplate, ConversationBuffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain [8], creating an advanced solution \\nfor early detection and comprehensive support within the field \\nof mental health. Additionally, the paper discusses the \\nimplementation of Streamlit to enhance the user experience \\nand interaction with the chatbot. \\nThe remainder of the paper is arranged accordingly. In \\nSection II, LangChain and its important components are \\nintroduced. The proposed methodology for developing the \\nwhole architecture is described in Section III. Section IV \\nprovides an overview of Streamlit. Section V provides an \\nillustration of sequential interaction of MindGuide chatbot \\nand human. The conclusion is drawn in Section V. \\nII. LANGCHAIN \\nLangChain, with its open-source essence, emerges as a \\npromising solution, aiming to simplify the complex process of \\ndeveloping applications powered by large language models \\n(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \\nblocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \\napplications shows the easy way developers can do it. \\nLangChain helps us to unlock the ability to harness the \\nLLM’s immense potential in tasks such as document analysis, \\nchatbot development, code analysis, and countless other \\napplications. Whether your desire is to unlock deeper natural \\nlanguage understanding, enhance data, or circumvent \\nlanguage barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \\nprovide the tools and programming support you need to do \\nwithout it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \\ncore functionalities encompass: \\n1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \\ndevelopment of applications that are inherently \\ncontext-aware. This means that these applications can \\nconnect to a language model and draw from various \\nsources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\\nshot examples, or existing content, to ground their \\nresponses effectively. \\n2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \\nwith the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \\nlanguage model, these applications can make informed \\ndecisions about how to respond based on the provided \\ncontext and determine the appropriate actions to take. \\nLangChain offers several key value propositions: \\nModular Components: It provides abstractions that \\nsimplify working with language models, along with a \\ncomprehensive collection of implementations for each \\nabstraction. These components are designed to be modular \\nand user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \\nutilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \\nOff-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \\nchains, which are structured assemblies of components \\ntailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\\ndefined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \\nan ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \\nuses below components from LangChain. \\nA. ChatModel \\nWithin LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \\nlanguage \\nmodel \\ncrafted \\nto \\nmanage \\nconversational \\ninteractions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \\nstring as input and generate a single string as output, \\nChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \\ngenerating a message as output. \\nEach message in the list has two parts: the content and the \\nrole. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \\nwhile the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \\nas \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \\nThis approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \\ndynamic and interactive conversations with the language \\nmodel. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \\ncustomer support systems, or any other application involving \\nmulti-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \\nChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \\ndesigned to function as mental health therapists. In our \\ninteraction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \\nengage with the ChatGpt3 turbo model and utilized a \\ntemperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \\nkey are outlined [9].  \\nB. Message \\nIn the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \\nmessages that are used as input when interacting with a \\nChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \\nor exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \\nlist typically consists of two components: \\n• \\ncontent: This represents the actual text or content of \\nthe message. It can be a user query, a system \\ninstruction, or any other relevant information. \\n• \\nrole: This represents the role or source of the \\nmessage. It defines who is speaking or generating \\nthe message. Common roles include \"User\", \\n\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \\ndefine. \\nThe chat model interface is based around messages rather \\nthan raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \\nare SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \\nSystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \\nin its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \\nMessage is a ChatMessage coming from a human/user. \\nAIMessage is a ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant as \\nillustrated in Figure 2.  \\n \\n                   Figure 1. A System Message illustration  \\nYou are a compassionate and experienced mental \\nhealth therapist with a proven track record of \\nhelping patients overcome anxiety and other mental \\nhealth challenges. Your primary objective is to \\nsupport the patient in addressing their concerns \\nand guiding them towards positive change. In this \\ninteractive therapy session, you will engage with \\nthe patient by asking open-ended questions, \\nactively listening to their responses, and providing \\nempathetic \\nfeedback. \\nYour \\napproach \\nis \\ncollaborative, and you strive to create a safe and \\nnon-judgmental space for the patient to share their \\nthoughts and feelings. \\nAs the patient shares their struggles, you will \\nprovide insightful guidance and evidence-based \\nstrategies tailored to their unique needs. You may \\nalso offer practical exercises or resources to help \\nthem manage their symptoms and improve their \\nmental wellbeing. When necessary, you will gently \\nredirect the conversation back to the patient\\'s \\nprimary concerns related to anxiety, mental health, \\nor family issues. This ensures that each session is \\nproductive and focused on addressing the most \\npressing issues. Throughout the session, you \\nremain mindful of the patient\\'s emotional state and \\nadjust your approach accordingly. \\nYou recognize that everyone\\'s journey is \\ndifferent, and that progress can be incremental.  \\nBy building trust and fostering a strong \\ntherapeutic relationship, you empower the patient \\nto take ownership of their growth and development. \\nAt the end of the session, you will summarize key \\npoints from your discussion, highlighting the \\npatient\\'s strengths and areas for improvement. \\nTogether, you will set achievable goals for future \\nsessions, reinforcing a sense of hope and \\nmotivation. Your ultimate goal is to equip the \\npatient with the tools and skills needed to navigate \\nlife\\'s challenges with confidence and resilience. \\n \\nFigure 2. An AIMessage illustration \\nC. Prompt Template \\nPrompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \\nThey provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \\nprovide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \\nhelp ensure that the LLM understands the desired context and \\nproduces relevant outputs. \\nThe prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \\nmake constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \\nthese classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \\nD. Chain \\nChains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \\nmultiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \\na structured and modular approach to building language \\nmodel applications. By combining different components, you \\ncan create chains that address various use cases and \\nrequirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \\n• \\nModularity: Chains allow you to break down \\ncomplex \\ntasks \\ninto \\nsmaller, \\nmanageable \\ncomponents. Each component can be developed and \\ntested independently, making it easier to maintain \\nand update the application. \\n• \\nSimplification: By combining components into a \\nchain, you can simplify the overall implementation \\nof your application. Chains abstract away the \\ncomplexity of working with individual components, \\nproviding a higher-level interface for developers. \\n• \\nDebugging: When an issue arises in your \\napplication, \\nchains \\ncan \\nhelp \\npinpoint \\nthe \\nproblematic component. By isolating the chain and \\ntesting each component individually, you can \\nidentify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \\nbehavior. \\n• \\nMaintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \\nreplace specific components without affecting the \\nentire application. If a new version of a component \\nbecomes available or if you want to switch to a \\ndiffer. \\nTo build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \\nin the order they should be executed. Each component in the \\nchain takes the output of the previous component as input, \\nallowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \\nlanguage model. \\nE. Memory  \\nThe ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \\nreferred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \\nprograms for increasing system memory. These utilities can \\nbe used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \\nability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \\nLangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \\nsystem. These utilities can be used by themselves or \\nincorporated seamlessly into a chain. \\nA memory system must support two fundamental \\nactions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \\nsome fundamental execution mechanism that requires \\nspecific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \\nthe user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \\nsingle run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \\n1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \\naugment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \\nuser inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \\n2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \\nsolution, a chain will WRITE the current run\\'s inputs \\nand outputs to memory so that they may be referred \\nto in subsequent runs. \\nAny memory system\\'s two primary design decisions are: \\n1. How state is stored ? \\nStoring: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \\nexchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \\nthese are immediately used, they must be preserved \\nin some manner. A series of integrations for storing \\nthese conversation messages, ranging from in-\\nmemory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \\ncomponent of the LangChain memory module. \\n2. How state is queried ? \\nQuerying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \\nchat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \\nsimple task. What is less obvious are the data \\nstructures and algorithms built on top of chat \\nconversations to provide the most usable view of \\nthose chats. \\nA simple memory system may only return the most \\nrecent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \\ncomplicated memory system may return a brief summary of \\nthe last K messages. A more complex system might extract \\nentities from stored messages and only return information \\nabout entities that have been referenced in the current run. \\nThere are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \\nof parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \\nsituations.  \\nMemory Types:  \\n• \\nConversationBufferMemory \\nallows \\nfor \\nsaving \\nmessages and then extracts the messages in a \\nvariable. \\n• \\nConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps a list of \\nthe interactions of the conversation over time. It only \\nuses the last K interactions. This can be useful for \\nkeeping a sliding window of the most recent \\ninteractions, so the buffer does not get too large. \\nThe MindGuide chatbot uses conversation buffer memory. \\nThis memory allows for storing messages and then extracts \\nthe messages in a variable. \\nIII. ARCHITETURE \\nIn crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \\nstep is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \\neffective user experience for those seeking mental health \\nsupport. The user interface, built on Streamlit, sets the tone \\nwith a friendly and safe welcome. Users can jump in by typing \\nWelcome! to your therapy session. I\\'m here to listen, \\nsupport, and guide you through any mental health \\nchallenges or concerns you may have. Please feel free \\nto share what\\'s on your mind, and we\\'ll work together \\nto address your needs. Remember, this is a safe and \\nconfidential space for you to express yourself. Let\\'s \\nbegin when you\\'re ready. \\ntheir mental health questions, kicking off a series of \\ninteractions with the LangChain framework. This is where the \\nmagic happens – LangChain acts as the brain behind the \\nchatbot, working through various components like chat \\nmessage templates and a memory concept to create a \\npersonalized and responsive support system. Each step is \\nbroken down. \\nStep 1. User Interface: Developed using the Streamlit \\nframework, the user interface welcomes users with a \\nmessage explaining the role of the chatbot in providing \\nmental health support. It assures users of a safe and \\nconfidential space to express their concerns.  \\nStep 2. User Input - Prompt: Users can input mental health-\\nrelated questions or seek advice by typing their queries \\ninto the input box integrated into the Streamlit interface. \\nStep 3. Data Transfer to LangChain: Implement the \\nfunctionality that sends the user\\'s input (question) as a \\nchat prompt template to the LangChain framework. This \\ninput serves as the \"human message prompt\" template. \\nStep 4. LangChain Framework: In this phase, the LangChain \\nframework serves as the backbone of the chatbot, where \\nall the foundational components and building blocks are \\nmeticulously orchestrated. Here\\'s a deeper dive into the \\ncritical elements of LangChain Processing: \\n• \\nChatMessage and Prompt Templates: Within \\nLangChain, the chatbot\\'s core communication \\ninfrastructure \\nis \\nestablished \\nby creating \\nChatMessage and prompt templates for optimal \\nchatbot engagement. \\n• \\nLLMChain and LLM Model Interaction: To \\nfacilitate interactions with the large language \\nmodel (LLM), a specialized component called \\nLLMChain is constructed. The LLMChain acts \\nas a conduit for managing the flow of \\nconversation between the chatbot and the LLM \\nmodel, in this case, GPT-4. \\n• \\nThe LLMChain handles both the user\\'s queries \\nand the chatbot\\'s responses, allowing for a \\ndynamic and coherent conversation flow. \\n• \\nChatmodel Class of LangChain: The LangChain \\nframework leverages the Chatmodel class, a \\ncritical component for interfacing with the \\nOpenAI model (GPT-4) for making requests to \\nthe language model and processing its \\nresponses, ensuring seamless communication \\nbetween the chatbot and the AI model. \\n• \\nMemory Concept: To enhance the chatbot\\'s \\nconversational capabilities and provide context-\\naware responses, LangChain incorporates a \\nmemory concept that allows the chatbot to retain \\nand access information from past interactions \\nwithin a session. The memory function enhances \\nconversations \\nby \\nretaining \\nuser \\nqueries, \\npreferences, and contextual details, thereby \\ncontributing \\nto \\na \\nmore \\neffective \\nand \\npersonalized interaction. This way, it tailors \\nresponses based on the user\\'s history throughout \\nthe session. \\nStep 5. Utilize the user\\'s question as input to construct a \\nchain of prompts that the large language model (in this \\ncase, GPT-4) will process. \\nStep 6. Model Response: Dispatch the constructed input \\nchain to the GPT-4 model for natural language \\nunderstanding and generation. The GPT-4 model \\ngenerates a response based on the input and context. \\nStep 7. Response to Streamlit: Receive the response \\ngenerated by the GPT-4 model and transmit it back to \\nthe Streamlit framework for display to the user. \\nStep 8. User Response Delivery: Present the model-\\ngenerated response to the user, thereby delivering the \\nmental health advice or information they sought.\\n \\nFigure 3. MindGuide Chatbot Architecture \\n \\nIV. STREAMLIT \\nStreamlit [13] is a faster way to build and share data apps. \\nStreamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in \\nminutes. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that \\nsimplifies the process of designing and sharing visually \\nappealing web applications, particularly well-suited for \\napplications involving machine learning and data science. \\nLeveraging Streamlit\\'s Python-based development approach, \\nyou can harness the power of Python to build a responsive and \\ndynamic web application. This is advantageous for developers \\nfamiliar with Python, as it allows for quick and efficient \\ndevelopment. \\n \\nV. MINDGUIDE CHATBOT INTERACTION  \\nThe MindGuide Bot interaction is illustrated in Fig. 4, \\ndepicting the following key elements:  \\n• \\nWelcome screen interface with AI message and \\nthe initial human interaction with MindGuide \\nChatbot (Fig. 4a). \\n• \\nMindGuide Chatbot\\'s AI response to the human \\nmessage, followed by the human\\'s mental health \\nquestion (Fig. 4b). \\n• \\nMindGuide Chatbot\\'s AI response to the \\nsubsequent human message, followed by another \\nmental health question from the human (Fig. 4c). \\n• \\nMindGuide \\nChatbot\\'s \\nAI \\nresponse \\nafter \\nanalyzing the latest human message (Fig. 4d). \\n \\n  \\n \\ns \\n                                                         (a)  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(b) \\n    \\n \\n \\n                                                         (c)  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(d) \\nFigure 4. Sequential Interaction with MindGuide Chatbot - (a) Welcome screen and initial AI message, (b) AI response to the first human message and \\nmental health question, (c) Subsequent AI response and continued interaction with another human mental health question, (d) AI response after analyzing the \\nlatest human message. \\nVI. CONCLUSION \\nThis paper employs the OpenAI chat model GPT-4 with a \\ntemperature setting of 0.5 to serve as an initial therapist, \\nproviding support for patients dealing with mental health \\nissues such as depression and anxiety. MindGuide relies on \\nthe ChatOpenAI model from LangChain as its foundation, \\nincorporating innovative features like ChatPrompt Template, \\nHuman Message Prompt Template, Conversation Buffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain to proactively identify issues and \\ndeliver comprehensive assistance. In the next phase, we plan \\nto enhance this chatbot further by implementing Retrieval-\\nAugmented Generation (RAG) and incorporating embedding \\nvectors for frequently asked questions related to mental health. \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] K.

      "core functionalities encompass: \n",
      "1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \n",
      "development of applications that are inherently \n",
      "context-aware. This means that these applications can \n",
      "connect to a language model and draw from various \n",
      "sources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\n",
      "shot examples, or existing content, to ground their \n",
      "responses effectively. \n",
      "2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \n",
      "with the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \n",
      "language model, these applications can make informed \n",
      "decisions about how to respond based on the provided \n",
      "context and determine the appropriate actions to take. \n",
      "LangChain offers several key value propositions: \n",
      "Modular Components: It provides abstractions that \n",
      "simplify working with language models, along with a \n",
      "comprehensive collection of implementations for each \n",
      "abstraction. These components are designed to be modular \n",
      "and user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \n",
      "utilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \n",
      "Off-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \n",
      "chains, which are structured assemblies of components \n",
      "tailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\n",
      "defined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \n",
      "an ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \n",
      "uses below components from LangChain. \n",
      "A. ChatModel \n",
      "Within LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \n",

      "crafted \n",
      "to \n",
      "manage \n",
      "conversational \n",
      "interactions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \n",
      "string as input and generate a single string as output, \n",
      "ChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \n",
      "generating a message as output. \n",
      "Each message in the list has two parts: the content and the \n",
      "role. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \n",
      "while the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \n",
      "as \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \n",

      "ChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \n",
      "or exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \n",
      "list typically consists of two components: \n",
      "• \n",
      "content: This represents the actual text or content of \n",
      "the message. It can be a user query, a system \n",
      "instruction, or any other relevant information. \n",
      "• \n",
      "role: This represents the role or source of the \n",

      "(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \n",
      "blocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \n",
      "applications shows the easy way developers can do it. \n",

      "language barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \n",
      "provide the tools and programming support you need to do \n",
      "without it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \n",
      "core functionalities encompass: \n",
      "1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \n",
      "development of applications that are inherently \n",
      "context-aware. This means that these applications can \n",
      "connect to a language model and draw from various \n",
      "sources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\n",
      "shot examples, or existing content, to ground their \n",
      "responses effectively. \n",
      "2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \n",
      "with the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \n",
      "language model, these applications can make informed \n",
      "decisions about how to respond based on the provided \n",
      "context and determine the appropriate actions to take. \n",
      "LangChain offers several key value propositions: \n",
      "Modular Components: It provides abstractions that \n",
      "simplify working with language models, along with a \n",
      "comprehensive collection of implementations for each \n",
      "abstraction. These components are designed to be modular \n",
      "and user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \n",
      "utilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \n",
      "Off-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \n",
      "chains, which are structured assemblies of components \n",
      "tailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\n",
      "defined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \n",
      "an ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \n",
      "uses below components from LangChain. \n",
      "A. ChatModel \n",
      "Within LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \n",
      "language \n",
      "model \n",
      "crafted \n",
      "to \n",
      "manage \n",
      "conversational \n",
      "interactions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \n",
      "string as input and generate a single string as output, \n",
      "ChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \n",
      "generating a message as output. \n",
      "Each message in the list has two parts: the content and the \n",
      "role. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \n",
      "while the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \n",
      "as \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \n",
      "This approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \n",
      "dynamic and interactive conversations with the language \n",
      "model. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \n",
      "customer support systems, or any other application involving \n",
      "multi-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \n",
      "ChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \n",
      "designed to function as mental health therapists. In our \n",
      "interaction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \n",

      "temperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \n",
      "key are outlined [9].  \n",
      "B. Message \n",
      "In the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \n",
      "messages that are used as input when interacting with a \n",
      "ChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \n",
      "or exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \n",
      "list typically consists of two components: \n",
      "• \n",
      "content: This represents the actual text or content of \n",
      "the message. It can be a user query, a system \n",
      "instruction, or any other relevant information. \n",
      "• \n",
      "role: This represents the role or source of the \n",
      "message. It defines who is speaking or generating \n",
      "the message. Common roles include \"User\", \n",
      "\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \n",
      "define. \n",
      "The chat model interface is based around messages rather \n",
      "than raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \n",
      "are SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \n",
      "SystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \n",
      "in its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \n",

      "Figure 2. An AIMessage illustration \n",
      "C. Prompt Template \n",
      "Prompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \n",
      "They provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \n",
      "provide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \n",

      "The prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \n",
      "make constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \n",
      "these classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \n",
      "D. Chain \n",
      "Chains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \n",
      "multiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \n",
      "a structured and modular approach to building language \n",
      "model applications. By combining different components, you \n",
      "can create chains that address various use cases and \n",
      "requirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \n",
      "• \n",
      "Modularity: Chains allow you to break down \n",
      "complex \n",
      "tasks \n",
      "into \n",
      "smaller, \n",
      "manageable \n",
      "components. Each component can be developed and \n",
      "tested independently, making it easier to maintain \n",
      "and update the application. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Simplification: By combining components into a \n",
      "chain, you can simplify the overall implementation \n",
      "of your application. Chains abstract away the \n",
      "complexity of working with individual components, \n",
      "providing a higher-level interface for developers. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Debugging: When an issue arises in your \n",
      "application, \n",
      "chains \n",
      "can \n",
      "help \n",

      "the \n",
      "problematic component. By isolating the chain and \n",
      "testing each component individually, you can \n",
      "identify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \n",
      "behavior. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Maintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \n",
      "replace specific components without affecting the \n",
      "entire application. If a new version of a component \n",
      "becomes available or if you want to switch to a \n",
      "differ. \n",
      "To build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \n",
      "in the order they should be executed. Each component in the \n",
      "chain takes the output of the previous component as input, \n",
      "allowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \n",
      "language model. \n",
      "E. Memory  \n",
      "The ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \n",
      "referred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \n",
      "programs for increasing system memory. These utilities can \n",
      "be used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \n",
      "ability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \n",
      "LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \n",
      "system. These utilities can be used by themselves or \n",
      "incorporated seamlessly into a chain. \n",
      "A memory system must support two fundamental \n",
      "actions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \n",
      "some fundamental execution mechanism that requires \n",
      "specific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \n",
      "the user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \n",
      "single run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \n",
      "1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \n",
      "augment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \n",
      "user inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \n",
      "2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \n",
      "solution, a chain will WRITE the current run's inputs \n",
      "and outputs to memory so that they may be referred \n",
      "to in subsequent runs. \n",
      "Any memory system's two primary design decisions are: \n",
      "1. How state is stored ? \n",
      "Storing: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \n",
      "exchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \n",
      "these are immediately used, they must be preserved \n",
      "in some manner. A series of integrations for storing \n",
      "these conversation messages, ranging from in-\n",
      "memory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \n",
      "component of the LangChain memory module. \n",
      "2. How state is queried ? \n",
      "Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \n",
      "chat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \n",
      "simple task. What is less obvious are the data \n",
      "structures and algorithms built on top of chat \n",
      "conversations to provide the most usable view of \n",
      "those chats. \n",
      "A simple memory system may only return the most \n",
      "recent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \n",
      "complicated memory system may return a brief summary of \n",
      "the last K messages. A more complex system might extract \n",
      "entities from stored messages and only return information \n",

      "2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \n",
      "with the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \n",
      "language model, these applications can make informed \n",
      "decisions about how to respond based on the provided \n",
      "context and determine the appropriate actions to take. \n",
      "LangChain offers several key value propositions: \n",

      "Off-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \n",
      "chains, which are structured assemblies of components \n",
      "tailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\n",
      "defined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \n",
      "an ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \n",
      "uses below components from LangChain. \n",
      "A. ChatModel \n",
      "Within LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \n",
      "language \n",
      "model \n",
      "crafted \n",
      "to \n",
      "manage \n",
      "conversational \n",
      "interactions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \n",
      "string as input and generate a single string as output, \n",
      "ChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \n",
      "generating a message as output. \n",
      "Each message in the list has two parts: the content and the \n",
      "role. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \n",
      "while the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \n",
      "as \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \n",

      "ChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \n",
      "or exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \n",
      "list typically consists of two components: \n",
      "• \n",
      "content: This represents the actual text or content of \n",
      "the message. It can be a user query, a system \n",
      "instruction, or any other relevant information. \n",
      "• \n",

      "multiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \n",
      "a structured and modular approach to building language \n",
      "model applications. By combining different components, you \n",
      "can create chains that address various use cases and \n",
      "requirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \n",
      "• \n",
      "Modularity: Chains allow you to break down \n",

      "language model. \n",
      "E. Memory  \n",
      "The ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \n",
      "referred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \n",
      "programs for increasing system memory. These utilities can \n",

      "incorporated seamlessly into a chain. \n",
      "A memory system must support two fundamental \n",
      "actions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \n",
      "some fundamental execution mechanism that requires \n",
      "specific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \n",
      "the user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \n",
      "single run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \n",
      "1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \n",
      "augment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \n",
      "user inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \n",
      "2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \n",
      "solution, a chain will WRITE the current run's inputs \n",
      "and outputs to memory so that they may be referred \n",
      "to in subsequent runs. \n",
      "Any memory system's two primary design decisions are: \n",
      "1. How state is stored ? \n",

      "exchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \n",
      "these are immediately used, they must be preserved \n",
      "in some manner. A series of integrations for storing \n",
      "these conversation messages, ranging from in-\n",

      "core functionalities encompass: \n",
      "1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \n",
      "development of applications that are inherently \n",
      "context-aware. This means that these applications can \n",
      "connect to a language model and draw from various \n",
      "sources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\n",
      "shot examples, or existing content, to ground their \n",
      "responses effectively. \n",
      "2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \n",
      "with the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \n",
      "language model, these applications can make informed \n",
      "decisions about how to respond based on the provided \n",
      "context and determine the appropriate actions to take. \n",
      "LangChain offers several key value propositions: \n",
      "Modular Components: It provides abstractions that \n",
      "simplify working with language models, along with a \n",
      "comprehensive collection of implementations for each \n",
      "abstraction. These components are designed to be modular \n",
      "and user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \n",

      "Off-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \n",
      "chains, which are structured assemblies of components \n",
      "tailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\n",
      "defined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \n",
      "an ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \n",
      "uses below components from LangChain. \n",
      "A. ChatModel \n",
      "Within LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \n",

      "crafted \n",
      "to \n",
      "manage \n",
      "conversational \n",
      "interactions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \n",
      "string as input and generate a single string as output, \n",
      "ChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \n",
      "generating a message as output. \n",
      "Each message in the list has two parts: the content and the \n",
      "role. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \n",
      "while the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \n",
      "as \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \n",

      "ChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \n",
      "or exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \n",
      "list typically consists of two components: \n",
      "• \n",
      "content: This represents the actual text or content of \n",
      "the message. It can be a user query, a system \n",
      "instruction, or any other relevant information. \n",
      "• \n",
      "role: This represents the role or source of the \n",

This paper \\ndelves into the application of recent advancements in pretrained \\ncontextualized language models to introduce MindGuide, an \\ninnovative chatbot serving as a mental health assistant for \\nindividuals seeking guidance and support in these critical areas. \\nMindGuide leverages the capabilities of LangChain and its \\nChatModels, specifically ChatOpenAI, as the bedrock of its \\nreasoning engine. The system incorporates key features such as \\nLangChain\\'s ChatPrompt Template, HumanMessage Prompt \\nTemplate, \\nConversationBufferMemory, \\nand \\nLLMChain, \\ncreating an advanced solution for early detection and \\ncomprehensive support within the field of mental health. \\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the implementation of \\nStreamlit to enhance the user experience and interaction with \\nthe chatbot. This novel approach holds great promise for \\nproactive mental health intervention and assistance. \\nKeywords —Large Language models, LangChain, Chatbot, \\nPretrained models, Mental health, Mental health support. \\nI. INTRODUCTION \\nThe issue of mental health is an international situation, \\naffecting people in each particularly developed nations and \\nemerging markets. According to the World Health \\nOrganization\\'s Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2020), it\\'s far \\nestimated that around one in four humans international face \\nnumerous kinds of mental disorders. This statistic underscores \\nthe vast nature of mental health demanding situations \\nthroughout extraordinary demographic businesses and areas. \\nHowever, what makes this situation even extra complex is \\nthe concerning truth that three out of each four people dealing \\nwith severe intellectual disorders do no longer have get entry \\nto the necessary remedy they require. This remedy gap \\nintensifies the weight of intellectual health troubles, leaving a \\nsizable part of the populace without the assist and care needed \\nto efficiently address their intellectual health issues. \\nFurthermore, periods like the recent global pandemic, the \\neffect of mental health issues becomes even more said. The \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted how \\npublic health crises can extensively have an effect on mental \\nproperly-being. During such hard instances, a widespread part \\nof the population faces extended problems in having access to \\nmental fitness professionals. This emphasizes the urgent want \\nfor progressed intellectual health offerings and support \\nstructures. It underscores the urgency of addressing the mental \\nhealth disaster and developing complete answers to make \\ncertain that people global have the means to successfully deal \\nwith their mental fitness challenges.. \\nIn studies [1], it\\'s pretty clear that there\\'s a deep connection \\nbetween mental troubles and the chances of someone taking \\ntheir own life. And when you look at the big picture, it\\'s quite \\nshocking - nearly a million people across the globe end their \\nlives every year, especially the young ones, making it the \\nsecond biggest reason for their passing. It\\'s intriguing that \\nwhen someone attempts suicide, they often grapple with \\nmental challenges. It\\'s like shifting from struggling with \\ndifficult thoughts to considering ending everything. This shift \\nis observable in how people express themselves and \\ninteract[2]. \\nOne practical approach to addressing mental illness and \\npreventing suicidal ideation is early identification. Recent \\nadvancements in deep learning have facilitated the \\ndevelopment of effective early detection methods [3]. A \\nnotable trend in natural language processing (NLP) involves \\nthe use of contextualized pretrained language models [4], \\nwhich have garnered substantial attention for their \\neffectiveness in various text processing tasks. \\nThis paper delves into the application of these recent \\nadvancements in pretrained contextualized large language \\nmodels to introduce MindGuide, an innovative chatbot \\ndesigned to function as a mental health assistant for \\nindividuals in need of guidance and support in these critical \\nareas. MindGuide relies on the capabilities of LangChain and \\nits ChatModels [5], specifically ChatOpenAI [6], as the \\nfoundation of its reasoning engine. The system incorporates \\nkey components such as LangChain’s ChatPrompt Template \\n[7], HumanMessage, PromptTemplate, ConversationBuffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain [8], creating an advanced solution \\nfor early detection and comprehensive support within the field \\nof mental health. Additionally, the paper discusses the \\nimplementation of Streamlit to enhance the user experience \\nand interaction with the chatbot. \\nThe remainder of the paper is arranged accordingly. In \\nSection II, LangChain and its important components are \\nintroduced. The proposed methodology for developing the \\nwhole architecture is described in Section III. Section IV \\nprovides an overview of Streamlit. Section V provides an \\nillustration of sequential interaction of MindGuide chatbot \\nand human. The conclusion is drawn in Section V. \\nII. LANGCHAIN \\nLangChain, with its open-source essence, emerges as a \\npromising solution, aiming to simplify the complex process of \\ndeveloping applications powered by large language models \\n(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \\nblocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \\napplications shows the easy way developers can do it. \\nLangChain helps us to unlock the ability to harness the \\nLLM’s immense potential in tasks such as document analysis, \\nchatbot development, code analysis, and countless other \\napplications. Whether your desire is to unlock deeper natural \\nlanguage understanding, enhance data, or circumvent \\nlanguage barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \\nprovide the tools and programming support you need to do \\nwithout it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \\ncore functionalities encompass: \\n1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \\ndevelopment of applications that are inherently \\ncontext-aware. This means that these applications can \\nconnect to a language model and draw from various \\nsources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\\nshot examples, or existing content, to ground their \\nresponses effectively. \\n2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \\nwith the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \\nlanguage model, these applications can make informed \\ndecisions about how to respond based on the provided \\ncontext and determine the appropriate actions to take. \\nLangChain offers several key value propositions: \\nModular Components: It provides abstractions that \\nsimplify working with language models, along with a \\ncomprehensive collection of implementations for each \\nabstraction. These components are designed to be modular \\nand user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \\nutilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \\nOff-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \\nchains, which are structured assemblies of components \\ntailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\\ndefined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \\nan ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \\nuses below components from LangChain. \\nA. ChatModel \\nWithin LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \\nlanguage \\nmodel \\ncrafted \\nto \\nmanage \\nconversational \\ninteractions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \\nstring as input and generate a single string as output, \\nChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \\ngenerating a message as output. \\nEach message in the list has two parts: the content and the \\nrole. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \\nwhile the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \\nas \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \\nThis approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \\ndynamic and interactive conversations with the language \\nmodel. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \\ncustomer support systems, or any other application involving \\nmulti-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \\nChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \\ndesigned to function as mental health therapists. In our \\ninteraction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \\nengage with the ChatGpt3 turbo model and utilized a \\ntemperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \\nkey are outlined [9].  \\nB. Message \\nIn the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \\nmessages that are used as input when interacting with a \\nChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \\nor exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \\nlist typically consists of two components: \\n• \\ncontent: This represents the actual text or content of \\nthe message. It can be a user query, a system \\ninstruction, or any other relevant information. \\n• \\nrole: This represents the role or source of the \\nmessage. It defines who is speaking or generating \\nthe message. Common roles include \"User\", \\n\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \\ndefine. \\nThe chat model interface is based around messages rather \\nthan raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \\nare SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \\nSystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \\nin its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \\nMessage is a ChatMessage coming from a human/user. \\nAIMessage is a ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant as \\nillustrated in Figure 2.  \\n \\n                   Figure 1. A System Message illustration  \\nYou are a compassionate and experienced mental \\nhealth therapist with a proven track record of \\nhelping patients overcome anxiety and other mental \\nhealth challenges. Your primary objective is to \\nsupport the patient in addressing their concerns \\nand guiding them towards positive change. In this \\ninteractive therapy session, you will engage with \\nthe patient by asking open-ended questions, \\nactively listening to their responses, and providing \\nempathetic \\nfeedback. \\nYour \\napproach \\nis \\ncollaborative, and you strive to create a safe and \\nnon-judgmental space for the patient to share their \\nthoughts and feelings. \\nAs the patient shares their struggles, you will \\nprovide insightful guidance and evidence-based \\nstrategies tailored to their unique needs. You may \\nalso offer practical exercises or resources to help \\nthem manage their symptoms and improve their \\nmental wellbeing. When necessary, you will gently \\nredirect the conversation back to the patient\\'s \\nprimary concerns related to anxiety, mental health, \\nor family issues. This ensures that each session is \\nproductive and focused on addressing the most \\npressing issues. Throughout the session, you \\nremain mindful of the patient\\'s emotional state and \\nadjust your approach accordingly. \\nYou recognize that everyone\\'s journey is \\ndifferent, and that progress can be incremental.  \\nBy building trust and fostering a strong \\ntherapeutic relationship, you empower the patient \\nto take ownership of their growth and development. \\nAt the end of the session, you will summarize key \\npoints from your discussion, highlighting the \\npatient\\'s strengths and areas for improvement. \\nTogether, you will set achievable goals for future \\nsessions, reinforcing a sense of hope and \\nmotivation. Your ultimate goal is to equip the \\npatient with the tools and skills needed to navigate \\nlife\\'s challenges with confidence and resilience. \\n \\nFigure 2. An AIMessage illustration \\nC. Prompt Template \\nPrompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \\nThey provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \\nprovide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \\nhelp ensure that the LLM understands the desired context and \\nproduces relevant outputs. \\nThe prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \\nmake constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \\nthese classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \\nD. Chain \\nChains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \\nmultiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \\na structured and modular approach to building language \\nmodel applications. By combining different components, you \\ncan create chains that address various use cases and \\nrequirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \\n• \\nModularity: Chains allow you to break down \\ncomplex \\ntasks \\ninto \\nsmaller, \\nmanageable \\ncomponents. Each component can be developed and \\ntested independently, making it easier to maintain \\nand update the application. \\n• \\nSimplification: By combining components into a \\nchain, you can simplify the overall implementation \\nof your application. Chains abstract away the \\ncomplexity of working with individual components, \\nproviding a higher-level interface for developers. \\n• \\nDebugging: When an issue arises in your \\napplication, \\nchains \\ncan \\nhelp \\npinpoint \\nthe \\nproblematic component. By isolating the chain and \\ntesting each component individually, you can \\nidentify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \\nbehavior. \\n• \\nMaintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \\nreplace specific components without affecting the \\nentire application. If a new version of a component \\nbecomes available or if you want to switch to a \\ndiffer. \\nTo build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \\nin the order they should be executed. Each component in the \\nchain takes the output of the previous component as input, \\nallowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \\nlanguage model. \\nE. Memory  \\nThe ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \\nreferred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \\nprograms for increasing system memory. These utilities can \\nbe used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \\nability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \\nLangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \\nsystem. These utilities can be used by themselves or \\nincorporated seamlessly into a chain. \\nA memory system must support two fundamental \\nactions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \\nsome fundamental execution mechanism that requires \\nspecific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \\nthe user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \\nsingle run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \\n1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \\naugment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \\nuser inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \\n2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \\nsolution, a chain will WRITE the current run\\'s inputs \\nand outputs to memory so that they may be referred \\nto in subsequent runs. \\nAny memory system\\'s two primary design decisions are: \\n1. How state is stored ? \\nStoring: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \\nexchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \\nthese are immediately used, they must be preserved \\nin some manner. A series of integrations for storing \\nthese conversation messages, ranging from in-\\nmemory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \\ncomponent of the LangChain memory module. \\n2. How state is queried ? \\nQuerying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \\nchat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \\nsimple task. What is less obvious are the data \\nstructures and algorithms built on top of chat \\nconversations to provide the most usable view of \\nthose chats. \\nA simple memory system may only return the most \\nrecent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \\ncomplicated memory system may return a brief summary of \\nthe last K messages. A more complex system might extract \\nentities from stored messages and only return information \\nabout entities that have been referenced in the current run. \\nThere are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \\nof parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \\nsituations.  \\nMemory Types:  \\n• \\nConversationBufferMemory \\nallows \\nfor \\nsaving \\nmessages and then extracts the messages in a \\nvariable. \\n• \\nConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps a list of \\nthe interactions of the conversation over time. It only \\nuses the last K interactions. This can be useful for \\nkeeping a sliding window of the most recent \\ninteractions, so the buffer does not get too large. \\nThe MindGuide chatbot uses conversation buffer memory. \\nThis memory allows for storing messages and then extracts \\nthe messages in a variable. \\nIII. ARCHITETURE \\nIn crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \\nstep is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \\neffective user experience for those seeking mental health \\nsupport. The user interface, built on Streamlit, sets the tone \\nwith a friendly and safe welcome. Users can jump in by typing \\nWelcome! to your therapy session. I\\'m here to listen, \\nsupport, and guide you through any mental health \\nchallenges or concerns you may have. Please feel free \\nto share what\\'s on your mind, and we\\'ll work together \\nto address your needs. Remember, this is a safe and \\nconfidential space for you to express yourself. Let\\'s \\nbegin when you\\'re ready. \\ntheir mental health questions, kicking off a series of \\ninteractions with the LangChain framework. This is where the \\nmagic happens – LangChain acts as the brain behind the \\nchatbot, working through various components like chat \\nmessage templates and a memory concept to create a \\npersonalized and responsive support system. Each step is \\nbroken down. \\nStep 1. User Interface: Developed using the Streamlit \\nframework, the user interface welcomes users with a \\nmessage explaining the role of the chatbot in providing \\nmental health support. It assures users of a safe and \\nconfidential space to express their concerns.  \\nStep 2. User Input - Prompt: Users can input mental health-\\nrelated questions or seek advice by typing their queries \\ninto the input box integrated into the Streamlit interface. \\nStep 3. Data Transfer to LangChain: Implement the \\nfunctionality that sends the user\\'s input (question) as a \\nchat prompt template to the LangChain framework. This \\ninput serves as the \"human message prompt\" template. \\nStep 4. LangChain Framework: In this phase, the LangChain \\nframework serves as the backbone of the chatbot, where \\nall the foundational components and building blocks are \\nmeticulously orchestrated. Here\\'s a deeper dive into the \\ncritical elements of LangChain Processing: \\n• \\nChatMessage and Prompt Templates: Within \\nLangChain, the chatbot\\'s core communication \\ninfrastructure \\nis \\nestablished \\nby creating \\nChatMessage and prompt templates for optimal \\nchatbot engagement. \\n• \\nLLMChain and LLM Model Interaction: To \\nfacilitate interactions with the large language \\nmodel (LLM), a specialized component called \\nLLMChain is constructed. The LLMChain acts \\nas a conduit for managing the flow of \\nconversation between the chatbot and the LLM \\nmodel, in this case, GPT-4. \\n• \\nThe LLMChain handles both the user\\'s queries \\nand the chatbot\\'s responses, allowing for a \\ndynamic and coherent conversation flow. \\n• \\nChatmodel Class of LangChain: The LangChain \\nframework leverages the Chatmodel class, a \\ncritical component for interfacing with the \\nOpenAI model (GPT-4) for making requests to \\nthe language model and processing its \\nresponses, ensuring seamless communication \\nbetween the chatbot and the AI model. \\n• \\nMemory Concept: To enhance the chatbot\\'s \\nconversational capabilities and provide context-\\naware responses, LangChain incorporates a \\nmemory concept that allows the chatbot to retain \\nand access information from past interactions \\nwithin a session. The memory function enhances \\nconversations \\nby \\nretaining \\nuser \\nqueries, \\npreferences, and contextual details, thereby \\ncontributing \\nto \\na \\nmore \\neffective \\nand \\npersonalized interaction. This way, it tailors \\nresponses based on the user\\'s history throughout \\nthe session. \\nStep 5. Utilize the user\\'s question as input to construct a \\nchain of prompts that the large language model (in this \\ncase, GPT-4) will process. \\nStep 6. Model Response: Dispatch the constructed input \\nchain to the GPT-4 model for natural language \\nunderstanding and generation. The GPT-4 model \\ngenerates a response based on the input and context. \\nStep 7. Response to Streamlit: Receive the response \\ngenerated by the GPT-4 model and transmit it back to \\nthe Streamlit framework for display to the user. \\nStep 8. User Response Delivery: Present the model-\\ngenerated response to the user, thereby delivering the \\nmental health advice or information they sought.\\n \\nFigure 3. MindGuide Chatbot Architecture \\n \\nIV. STREAMLIT \\nStreamlit [13] is a faster way to build and share data apps. \\nStreamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in \\nminutes. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that \\nsimplifies the process of designing and sharing visually \\nappealing web applications, particularly well-suited for \\napplications involving machine learning and data science. \\nLeveraging Streamlit\\'s Python-based development approach, \\nyou can harness the power of Python to build a responsive and \\ndynamic web application. This is advantageous for developers \\nfamiliar with Python, as it allows for quick and efficient \\ndevelopment. \\n \\nV. MINDGUIDE CHATBOT INTERACTION  \\nThe MindGuide Bot interaction is illustrated in Fig. 4, \\ndepicting the following key elements:  \\n• \\nWelcome screen interface with AI message and \\nthe initial human interaction with MindGuide \\nChatbot (Fig. 4a). \\n• \\nMindGuide Chatbot\\'s AI response to the human \\nmessage, followed by the human\\'s mental health \\nquestion (Fig. 4b). \\n• \\nMindGuide Chatbot\\'s AI response to the \\nsubsequent human message, followed by another \\nmental health question from the human (Fig. 4c). \\n• \\nMindGuide \\nChatbot\\'s \\nAI \\nresponse \\nafter \\nanalyzing the latest human message (Fig. 4d). \\n \\n  \\n \\ns \\n                                                         (a)  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(b) \\n    \\n \\n \\n                                                         (c)  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(d) \\nFigure 4. Sequential Interaction with MindGuide Chatbot - (a) Welcome screen and initial AI message, (b) AI response to the first human message and \\nmental health question, (c) Subsequent AI response and continued interaction with another human mental health question, (d) AI response after analyzing the \\nlatest human message. \\nVI. CONCLUSION \\nThis paper employs the OpenAI chat model GPT-4 with a \\ntemperature setting of 0.5 to serve as an initial therapist, \\nproviding support for patients dealing with mental health \\nissues such as depression and anxiety. MindGuide relies on \\nthe ChatOpenAI model from LangChain as its foundation, \\nincorporating innovative features like ChatPrompt Template, \\nHuman Message Prompt Template, Conversation Buffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain to proactively identify issues and \\ndeliver comprehensive assistance. In the next phase, we plan \\nto enhance this chatbot further by implementing Retrieval-\\nAugmented Generation (RAG) and incorporating embedding \\nvectors for frequently asked questions related to mental health. \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] K.

      "The issue of mental health is an international situation, \n",
      "affecting people in each particularly developed nations and \n",
      "emerging markets. According to the World Health \n",
      "Organization's Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2020), it's far \n",
      "estimated that around one in four humans international face \n",
      "numerous kinds of mental disorders. This statistic underscores \n",
      "the vast nature of mental health demanding situations \n",
      "throughout extraordinary demographic businesses and areas. \n",
      "However, what makes this situation even extra complex is \n",
      "the concerning truth that three out of each four people dealing \n",
      "with severe intellectual disorders do no longer have get entry \n",
      "to the necessary remedy they require. This remedy gap \n",
      "intensifies the weight of intellectual health troubles, leaving a \n",
      "sizable part of the populace without the assist and care needed \n",
      "to efficiently address their intellectual health issues. \n",
      "Furthermore, periods like the recent global pandemic, the \n",
      "effect of mental health issues becomes even more said. The \n",
      "COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted how \n",
      "public health crises can extensively have an effect on mental \n",
      "properly-being. During such hard instances, a widespread part \n",
      "of the population faces extended problems in having access to \n",
      "mental fitness professionals. This emphasizes the urgent want \n",
      "for progressed intellectual health offerings and support \n",
      "structures. It underscores the urgency of addressing the mental \n",
      "health disaster and developing complete answers to make \n",
      "certain that people global have the means to successfully deal \n",
      "with their mental fitness challenges.. \n",
      "In studies [1], it's pretty clear that there's a deep connection \n",
      "between mental troubles and the chances of someone taking \n",
      "their own life. And when you look at the big picture, it's quite \n",
      "shocking - nearly a million people across the globe end their \n",
      "lives every year, especially the young ones, making it the \n",
      "second biggest reason for their passing. It's intriguing that \n",
      "when someone attempts suicide, they often grapple with \n",

      "LangChain, with its open-source essence, emerges as a \n",
      "promising solution, aiming to simplify the complex process of \n",
      "developing applications powered by large language models \n",
      "(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \n",
      "blocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \n",
      "applications shows the easy way developers can do it. \n",
      "LangChain helps us to unlock the ability to harness the \n",
      "LLM’s immense potential in tasks such as document analysis, \n",
      "chatbot development, code analysis, and countless other \n",
      "applications. Whether your desire is to unlock deeper natural \n",
      "language understanding, enhance data, or circumvent \n",
      "language barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \n",
      "provide the tools and programming support you need to do \n",
      "without it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \n",
      "core functionalities encompass: \n",
      "1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \n",
      "development of applications that are inherently \n",
      "context-aware. This means that these applications can \n",
      "connect to a language model and draw from various \n",
      "sources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\n",
      "shot examples, or existing content, to ground their \n",
      "responses effectively. \n",
      "2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \n",
      "with the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \n",
      "language model, these applications can make informed \n",
      "decisions about how to respond based on the provided \n",
      "context and determine the appropriate actions to take. \n",
      "LangChain offers several key value propositions: \n",
      "Modular Components: It provides abstractions that \n",
      "simplify working with language models, along with a \n",
      "comprehensive collection of implementations for each \n",
      "abstraction. These components are designed to be modular \n",
      "and user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \n",
      "utilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \n",
      "Off-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \n",
      "chains, which are structured assemblies of components \n",
      "tailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\n",
      "defined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \n",
      "an ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \n",
      "uses below components from LangChain. \n",
      "A. ChatModel \n",
      "Within LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \n",
      "language \n",
      "model \n",
      "crafted \n",
      "to \n",
      "manage \n",
      "conversational \n",
      "interactions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \n",
      "string as input and generate a single string as output, \n",
      "ChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \n",
      "generating a message as output. \n",
      "Each message in the list has two parts: the content and the \n",
      "role. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \n",
      "while the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \n",
      "as \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \n",
      "This approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \n",
      "dynamic and interactive conversations with the language \n",
      "model. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \n",
      "customer support systems, or any other application involving \n",
      "multi-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \n",
      "ChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \n",
      "designed to function as mental health therapists. In our \n",
      "interaction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \n",
      "engage with the ChatGpt3 turbo model and utilized a \n",
      "temperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \n",
      "key are outlined [9].  \n",
      "B. Message \n",
      "In the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \n",
      "messages that are used as input when interacting with a \n",
      "ChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \n",
      "or exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \n",
      "list typically consists of two components: \n",
      "• \n",
      "content: This represents the actual text or content of \n",
      "the message. It can be a user query, a system \n",
      "instruction, or any other relevant information. \n",
      "• \n",
      "role: This represents the role or source of the \n",
      "message. It defines who is speaking or generating \n",
      "the message. Common roles include \"User\", \n",
      "\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \n",
      "define. \n",
      "The chat model interface is based around messages rather \n",
      "than raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \n",
      "are SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \n",
      "SystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \n",
      "in its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \n",
      "Message is a ChatMessage coming from a human/user. \n",
      "AIMessage is a ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant as \n",

      "also offer practical exercises or resources to help \n",
      "them manage their symptoms and improve their \n",
      "mental wellbeing. When necessary, you will gently \n",
      "redirect the conversation back to the patient's \n",
      "primary concerns related to anxiety, mental health, \n",
      "or family issues. This ensures that each session is \n",
      "productive and focused on addressing the most \n",
      "pressing issues. Throughout the session, you \n",
      "remain mindful of the patient's emotional state and \n",
      "adjust your approach accordingly. \n",
      "You recognize that everyone's journey is \n",
      "different, and that progress can be incremental.  \n",
      "By building trust and fostering a strong \n",
      "therapeutic relationship, you empower the patient \n",

      "life's challenges with confidence and resilience. \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 2. An AIMessage illustration \n",
      "C. Prompt Template \n",
      "Prompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \n",
      "They provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \n",
      "provide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \n",
      "help ensure that the LLM understands the desired context and \n",
      "produces relevant outputs. \n",
      "The prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \n",
      "make constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \n",
      "these classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \n",
      "D. Chain \n",
      "Chains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \n",
      "multiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \n",
      "a structured and modular approach to building language \n",
      "model applications. By combining different components, you \n",
      "can create chains that address various use cases and \n",
      "requirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \n",
      "• \n",
      "Modularity: Chains allow you to break down \n",
      "complex \n",
      "tasks \n",
      "into \n",
      "smaller, \n",
      "manageable \n",
      "components. Each component can be developed and \n",
      "tested independently, making it easier to maintain \n",
      "and update the application. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Simplification: By combining components into a \n",
      "chain, you can simplify the overall implementation \n",
      "of your application. Chains abstract away the \n",
      "complexity of working with individual components, \n",
      "providing a higher-level interface for developers. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Debugging: When an issue arises in your \n",
      "application, \n",
      "chains \n",
      "can \n",
      "help \n",
      "pinpoint \n",
      "the \n",
      "problematic component. By isolating the chain and \n",
      "testing each component individually, you can \n",
      "identify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \n",
      "behavior. \n",
      "• \n",
      "Maintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \n",
      "replace specific components without affecting the \n",
      "entire application. If a new version of a component \n",
      "becomes available or if you want to switch to a \n",
      "differ. \n",
      "To build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \n",
      "in the order they should be executed. Each component in the \n",
      "chain takes the output of the previous component as input, \n",
      "allowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \n",
      "language model. \n",
      "E. Memory  \n",
      "The ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \n",
      "referred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \n",
      "programs for increasing system memory. These utilities can \n",
      "be used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \n",
      "ability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \n",
      "LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \n",
      "system. These utilities can be used by themselves or \n",
      "incorporated seamlessly into a chain. \n",
      "A memory system must support two fundamental \n",
      "actions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \n",
      "some fundamental execution mechanism that requires \n",
      "specific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \n",
      "the user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \n",
      "single run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \n",
      "1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \n",
      "augment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \n",
      "user inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \n",
      "2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \n",
      "solution, a chain will WRITE the current run's inputs \n",
      "and outputs to memory so that they may be referred \n",
      "to in subsequent runs. \n",
      "Any memory system's two primary design decisions are: \n",
      "1. How state is stored ? \n",
      "Storing: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \n",
      "exchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \n",
      "these are immediately used, they must be preserved \n",
      "in some manner. A series of integrations for storing \n",
      "these conversation messages, ranging from in-\n",
      "memory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \n",
      "component of the LangChain memory module. \n",
      "2. How state is queried ? \n",
      "Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \n",
      "chat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \n",
      "simple task. What is less obvious are the data \n",
      "structures and algorithms built on top of chat \n",
      "conversations to provide the most usable view of \n",
      "those chats. \n",
      "A simple memory system may only return the most \n",
      "recent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \n",
      "complicated memory system may return a brief summary of \n",
      "the last K messages. A more complex system might extract \n",
      "entities from stored messages and only return information \n",
      "about entities that have been referenced in the current run. \n",
      "There are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \n",
      "of parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \n",
      "situations.  \n",
      "Memory Types:  \n",
      "• \n",
      "ConversationBufferMemory \n",
      "allows \n",
      "for \n",
      "saving \n",
      "messages and then extracts the messages in a \n",
      "variable. \n",
      "• \n",
      "ConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps a list of \n",
      "the interactions of the conversation over time. It only \n",
      "uses the last K interactions. This can be useful for \n",
      "keeping a sliding window of the most recent \n",
      "interactions, so the buffer does not get too large. \n",
      "The MindGuide chatbot uses conversation buffer memory. \n",

      "III. ARCHITETURE \n",
      "In crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \n",
      "step is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \n",
      "effective user experience for those seeking mental health \n",

INTRODUCTION \\nThe issue of mental health is an international situation, \\naffecting people in each particularly developed nations and \\nemerging markets. According to the World Health \\nOrganization\\'s Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2020), it\\'s far \\nestimated that around one in four humans international face \\nnumerous kinds of mental disorders. This statistic underscores \\nthe vast nature of mental health demanding situations \\nthroughout extraordinary demographic businesses and areas. \\nHowever, what makes this situation even extra complex is \\nthe concerning truth that three out of each four people dealing \\nwith severe intellectual disorders do no longer have get entry \\nto the necessary remedy they require. This remedy gap \\nintensifies the weight of intellectual health troubles, leaving a \\nsizable part of the populace without the assist and care needed \\nto efficiently address their intellectual health issues. \\nFurthermore, periods like the recent global pandemic, the \\neffect of mental health issues becomes even more said. The \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted how \\npublic health crises can extensively have an effect on mental \\nproperly-being. During such hard instances, a widespread part \\nof the population faces extended problems in having access to \\nmental fitness professionals. This emphasizes the urgent want \\nfor progressed intellectual health offerings and support \\nstructures. It underscores the urgency of addressing the mental \\nhealth disaster and developing complete answers to make \\ncertain that people global have the means to successfully deal \\nwith their mental fitness challenges.. \\nIn studies [1], it\\'s pretty clear that there\\'s a deep connection \\nbetween mental troubles and the chances of someone taking \\ntheir own life. And when you look at the big picture, it\\'s quite \\nshocking - nearly a million people across the globe end their \\nlives every year, especially the young ones, making it the \\nsecond biggest reason for their passing. It\\'s intriguing that \\nwhen someone attempts suicide, they often grapple with \\nmental challenges. It\\'s like shifting from struggling with \\ndifficult thoughts to considering ending everything. This shift \\nis observable in how people express themselves and \\ninteract[2]. \\nOne practical approach to addressing mental illness and \\npreventing suicidal ideation is early identification. Recent \\nadvancements in deep learning have facilitated the \\ndevelopment of effective early detection methods [3]. A \\nnotable trend in natural language processing (NLP) involves \\nthe use of contextualized pretrained language models [4], \\nwhich have garnered substantial attention for their \\neffectiveness in various text processing tasks. \\nThis paper delves into the application of these recent \\nadvancements in pretrained contextualized large language \\nmodels to introduce MindGuide, an innovative chatbot \\ndesigned to function as a mental health assistant for \\nindividuals in need of guidance and support in these critical \\nareas. MindGuide relies on the capabilities of LangChain and \\nits ChatModels [5], specifically ChatOpenAI [6], as the \\nfoundation of its reasoning engine. The system incorporates \\nkey components such as LangChain’s ChatPrompt Template \\n[7], HumanMessage, PromptTemplate, ConversationBuffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain [8], creating an advanced solution \\nfor early detection and comprehensive support within the field \\nof mental health. Additionally, the paper discusses the \\nimplementation of Streamlit to enhance the user experience \\nand interaction with the chatbot. \\nThe remainder of the paper is arranged accordingly. In \\nSection II, LangChain and its important components are \\nintroduced. The proposed methodology for developing the \\nwhole architecture is described in Section III. Section IV \\nprovides an overview of Streamlit. Section V provides an \\nillustration of sequential interaction of MindGuide chatbot \\nand human. The conclusion is drawn in Section V. \\nII. LANGCHAIN \\nLangChain, with its open-source essence, emerges as a \\npromising solution, aiming to simplify the complex process of \\ndeveloping applications powered by large language models \\n(LLMs). This framework though the rapid delivery of building \\nblocks and pre-built chains for building large language model \\napplications shows the easy way developers can do it. \\nLangChain helps us to unlock the ability to harness the \\nLLM’s immense potential in tasks such as document analysis, \\nchatbot development, code analysis, and countless other \\napplications. Whether your desire is to unlock deeper natural \\nlanguage understanding, enhance data, or circumvent \\nlanguage barriers through translation, LangChain is ready to \\nprovide the tools and programming support you need to do \\nwithout it that it is not only difficult but also fresh for you. Its \\ncore functionalities encompass: \\n1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \\ndevelopment of applications that are inherently \\ncontext-aware. This means that these applications can \\nconnect to a language model and draw from various \\nsources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\\nshot examples, or existing content, to ground their \\nresponses effectively. \\n2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \\nwith the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \\nlanguage model, these applications can make informed \\ndecisions about how to respond based on the provided \\ncontext and determine the appropriate actions to take. \\nLangChain offers several key value propositions: \\nModular Components: It provides abstractions that \\nsimplify working with language models, along with a \\ncomprehensive collection of implementations for each \\nabstraction. These components are designed to be modular \\nand user-friendly, making them useful whether you are \\nutilizing the entire LangChain framework or not. \\nOff-the-Shelf Chains: LangChain offers pre-configured \\nchains, which are structured assemblies of components \\ntailored to accomplish specific high-level tasks. These pre-\\ndefined chains streamline the initial setup process and serve as \\nan ideal starting point for your projects. The MindGuide Bot \\nuses below components from LangChain. \\nA. ChatModel \\nWithin LangChain, a ChatModel is a specific kind of \\nlanguage \\nmodel \\ncrafted \\nto \\nmanage \\nconversational \\ninteractions. Unlike traditional language models that take one \\nstring as input and generate a single string as output, \\nChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \\ngenerating a message as output. \\nEach message in the list has two parts: the content and the \\nrole. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \\nwhile the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \\nas \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \\nThis approach with ChatModels opens the door to more \\ndynamic and interactive conversations with the language \\nmodel. It empowers the creation of chatbot applications, \\ncustomer support systems, or any other application involving \\nmulti-turn conversations. We utilized the ChatOpenAI \\nChatModel to create MindGuide chatbots specifically \\ndesigned to function as mental health therapists. In our \\ninteraction with OpenAI, we opted for an OpenAI API key to \\nengage with the ChatGpt3 turbo model and utilized a \\ntemperature value of 0.5. The steps to create an OpenAI API \\nkey are outlined [9].  \\nB. Message \\nIn the context of LangChain, messages [10] refer to a list of \\nmessages that are used as input when interacting with a \\nChatModel. Each message in the list represents a specific turn \\nor exchange in a conversation. Each message in the messages \\nlist typically consists of two components: \\n• \\ncontent: This represents the actual text or content of \\nthe message. It can be a user query, a system \\ninstruction, or any other relevant information. \\n• \\nrole: This represents the role or source of the \\nmessage. It defines who is speaking or generating \\nthe message. Common roles include \"User\", \\n\"Assistant\", \"System\", or any other custom role you \\ndefine. \\nThe chat model interface is based around messages rather \\nthan raw text. The types of messages supported in LangChain \\nare SystenMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. \\nSystemMessage is the ChatMessage coming from the system \\nin its LangChain template as illustrated in Figure 1. Human \\nMessage is a ChatMessage coming from a human/user. \\nAIMessage is a ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant as \\nillustrated in Figure 2.  \\n \\n                   Figure 1. A System Message illustration  \\nYou are a compassionate and experienced mental \\nhealth therapist with a proven track record of \\nhelping patients overcome anxiety and other mental \\nhealth challenges. Your primary objective is to \\nsupport the patient in addressing their concerns \\nand guiding them towards positive change. In this \\ninteractive therapy session, you will engage with \\nthe patient by asking open-ended questions, \\nactively listening to their responses, and providing \\nempathetic \\nfeedback. \\nYour \\napproach \\nis \\ncollaborative, and you strive to create a safe and \\nnon-judgmental space for the patient to share their \\nthoughts and feelings. \\nAs the patient shares their struggles, you will \\nprovide insightful guidance and evidence-based \\nstrategies tailored to their unique needs. You may \\nalso offer practical exercises or resources to help \\nthem manage their symptoms and improve their \\nmental wellbeing. When necessary, you will gently \\nredirect the conversation back to the patient\\'s \\nprimary concerns related to anxiety, mental health, \\nor family issues. This ensures that each session is \\nproductive and focused on addressing the most \\npressing issues. Throughout the session, you \\nremain mindful of the patient\\'s emotional state and \\nadjust your approach accordingly. \\nYou recognize that everyone\\'s journey is \\ndifferent, and that progress can be incremental.  \\nBy building trust and fostering a strong \\ntherapeutic relationship, you empower the patient \\nto take ownership of their growth and development. \\nAt the end of the session, you will summarize key \\npoints from your discussion, highlighting the \\npatient\\'s strengths and areas for improvement. \\nTogether, you will set achievable goals for future \\nsessions, reinforcing a sense of hope and \\nmotivation. Your ultimate goal is to equip the \\npatient with the tools and skills needed to navigate \\nlife\\'s challenges with confidence and resilience. \\n \\nFigure 2. An AIMessage illustration \\nC. Prompt Template \\nPrompt templates [10] allow you to structure input for LLMs. \\nThey provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \\nprovide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \\nhelp ensure that the LLM understands the desired context and \\nproduces relevant outputs. \\nThe prompt template classes in LangChain are built to \\nmake constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \\nthese classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate. \\nD. Chain \\nChains [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \\nmultiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \\na structured and modular approach to building language \\nmodel applications. By combining different components, you \\ncan create chains that address various use cases and \\nrequirements. Here are some advantages of using chains: \\n• \\nModularity: Chains allow you to break down \\ncomplex \\ntasks \\ninto \\nsmaller, \\nmanageable \\ncomponents. Each component can be developed and \\ntested independently, making it easier to maintain \\nand update the application. \\n• \\nSimplification: By combining components into a \\nchain, you can simplify the overall implementation \\nof your application. Chains abstract away the \\ncomplexity of working with individual components, \\nproviding a higher-level interface for developers. \\n• \\nDebugging: When an issue arises in your \\napplication, \\nchains \\ncan \\nhelp \\npinpoint \\nthe \\nproblematic component. By isolating the chain and \\ntesting each component individually, you can \\nidentify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \\nbehavior. \\n• \\nMaintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \\nreplace specific components without affecting the \\nentire application. If a new version of a component \\nbecomes available or if you want to switch to a \\ndiffer. \\nTo build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \\nin the order they should be executed. Each component in the \\nchain takes the output of the previous component as input, \\nallowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \\nlanguage model. \\nE. Memory  \\nThe ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \\nreferred to as memory [12]. LangChain includes several \\nprograms for increasing system memory. These utilities can \\nbe used independently or as a part of a chain. We call this \\nability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \\nLangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a \\nsystem. These utilities can be used by themselves or \\nincorporated seamlessly into a chain. \\nA memory system must support two fundamental \\nactions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \\nsome fundamental execution mechanism that requires \\nspecific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \\nthe user, while others may be retrieved from memory. In a \\nsingle run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice. \\n1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \\naugment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \\nuser inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic. \\n2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \\nsolution, a chain will WRITE the current run\\'s inputs \\nand outputs to memory so that they may be referred \\nto in subsequent runs. \\nAny memory system\\'s two primary design decisions are: \\n1. How state is stored ? \\nStoring: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \\nexchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \\nthese are immediately used, they must be preserved \\nin some manner. A series of integrations for storing \\nthese conversation messages, ranging from in-\\nmemory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \\ncomponent of the LangChain memory module. \\n2. How state is queried ? \\nQuerying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \\nchat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \\nsimple task. What is less obvious are the data \\nstructures and algorithms built on top of chat \\nconversations to provide the most usable view of \\nthose chats. \\nA simple memory system may only return the most \\nrecent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \\ncomplicated memory system may return a brief summary of \\nthe last K messages. A more complex system might extract \\nentities from stored messages and only return information \\nabout entities that have been referenced in the current run. \\nThere are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \\nof parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \\nsituations.  \\nMemory Types:  \\n• \\nConversationBufferMemory \\nallows \\nfor \\nsaving \\nmessages and then extracts the messages in a \\nvariable. \\n• \\nConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps a list of \\nthe interactions of the conversation over time. It only \\nuses the last K interactions. This can be useful for \\nkeeping a sliding window of the most recent \\ninteractions, so the buffer does not get too large. \\nThe MindGuide chatbot uses conversation buffer memory. \\nThis memory allows for storing messages and then extracts \\nthe messages in a variable. \\nIII. ARCHITETURE \\nIn crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \\nstep is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \\neffective user experience for those seeking mental health \\nsupport. The user interface, built on Streamlit, sets the tone \\nwith a friendly and safe welcome. Users can jump in by typing \\nWelcome! to your therapy session. I\\'m here to listen, \\nsupport, and guide you through any mental health \\nchallenges or concerns you may have. Please feel free \\nto share what\\'s on your mind, and we\\'ll work together \\nto address your needs. Remember, this is a safe and \\nconfidential space for you to express yourself. Let\\'s \\nbegin when you\\'re ready. \\ntheir mental health questions, kicking off a series of \\ninteractions with the LangChain framework. This is where the \\nmagic happens – LangChain acts as the brain behind the \\nchatbot, working through various components like chat \\nmessage templates and a memory concept to create a \\npersonalized and responsive support system. Each step is \\nbroken down. \\nStep 1. User Interface: Developed using the Streamlit \\nframework, the user interface welcomes users with a \\nmessage explaining the role of the chatbot in providing \\nmental health support. It assures users of a safe and \\nconfidential space to express their concerns.  \\nStep 2. User Input - Prompt: Users can input mental health-\\nrelated questions or seek advice by typing their queries \\ninto the input box integrated into the Streamlit interface. \\nStep 3. Data Transfer to LangChain: Implement the \\nfunctionality that sends the user\\'s input (question) as a \\nchat prompt template to the LangChain framework. This \\ninput serves as the \"human message prompt\" template. \\nStep 4. LangChain Framework: In this phase, the LangChain \\nframework serves as the backbone of the chatbot, where \\nall the foundational components and building blocks are \\nmeticulously orchestrated. Here\\'s a deeper dive into the \\ncritical elements of LangChain Processing: \\n• \\nChatMessage and Prompt Templates: Within \\nLangChain, the chatbot\\'s core communication \\ninfrastructure \\nis \\nestablished \\nby creating \\nChatMessage and prompt templates for optimal \\nchatbot engagement. \\n• \\nLLMChain and LLM Model Interaction: To \\nfacilitate interactions with the large language \\nmodel (LLM), a specialized component called \\nLLMChain is constructed. The LLMChain acts \\nas a conduit for managing the flow of \\nconversation between the chatbot and the LLM \\nmodel, in this case, GPT-4. \\n• \\nThe LLMChain handles both the user\\'s queries \\nand the chatbot\\'s responses, allowing for a \\ndynamic and coherent conversation flow. \\n• \\nChatmodel Class of LangChain: The LangChain \\nframework leverages the Chatmodel class, a \\ncritical component for interfacing with the \\nOpenAI model (GPT-4) for making requests to \\nthe language model and processing its \\nresponses, ensuring seamless communication \\nbetween the chatbot and the AI model. \\n• \\nMemory Concept: To enhance the chatbot\\'s \\nconversational capabilities and provide context-\\naware responses, LangChain incorporates a \\nmemory concept that allows the chatbot to retain \\nand access information from past interactions \\nwithin a session. The memory function enhances \\nconversations \\nby \\nretaining \\nuser \\nqueries, \\npreferences, and contextual details, thereby \\ncontributing \\nto \\na \\nmore \\neffective \\nand \\npersonalized interaction. This way, it tailors \\nresponses based on the user\\'s history throughout \\nthe session. \\nStep 5. Utilize the user\\'s question as input to construct a \\nchain of prompts that the large language model (in this \\ncase, GPT-4) will process. \\nStep 6. Model Response: Dispatch the constructed input \\nchain to the GPT-4 model for natural language \\nunderstanding and generation. The GPT-4 model \\ngenerates a response based on the input and context. \\nStep 7. Response to Streamlit: Receive the response \\ngenerated by the GPT-4 model and transmit it back to \\nthe Streamlit framework for display to the user. \\nStep 8. User Response Delivery: Present the model-\\ngenerated response to the user, thereby delivering the \\nmental health advice or information they sought.\\n \\nFigure 3. MindGuide Chatbot Architecture \\n \\nIV. STREAMLIT \\nStreamlit [13] is a faster way to build and share data apps. \\nStreamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in \\nminutes. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that \\nsimplifies the process of designing and sharing visually \\nappealing web applications, particularly well-suited for \\napplications involving machine learning and data science. \\nLeveraging Streamlit\\'s Python-based development approach, \\nyou can harness the power of Python to build a responsive and \\ndynamic web application. This is advantageous for developers \\nfamiliar with Python, as it allows for quick and efficient \\ndevelopment. \\n \\nV. MINDGUIDE CHATBOT INTERACTION  \\nThe MindGuide Bot interaction is illustrated in Fig. 4, \\ndepicting the following key elements:  \\n• \\nWelcome screen interface with AI message and \\nthe initial human interaction with MindGuide \\nChatbot (Fig. 4a). \\n• \\nMindGuide Chatbot\\'s AI response to the human \\nmessage, followed by the human\\'s mental health \\nquestion (Fig. 4b). \\n• \\nMindGuide Chatbot\\'s AI response to the \\nsubsequent human message, followed by another \\nmental health question from the human (Fig. 4c). \\n• \\nMindGuide \\nChatbot\\'s \\nAI \\nresponse \\nafter \\nanalyzing the latest human message (Fig. 4d). \\n \\n  \\n \\ns \\n                                                         (a)  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(b) \\n    \\n \\n \\n                                                         (c)  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(d) \\nFigure 4. Sequential Interaction with MindGuide Chatbot - (a) Welcome screen and initial AI message, (b) AI response to the first human message and \\nmental health question, (c) Subsequent AI response and continued interaction with another human mental health question, (d) AI response after analyzing the \\nlatest human message. \\nVI. CONCLUSION \\nThis paper employs the OpenAI chat model GPT-4 with a \\ntemperature setting of 0.5 to serve as an initial therapist, \\nproviding support for patients dealing with mental health \\nissues such as depression and anxiety. MindGuide relies on \\nthe ChatOpenAI model from LangChain as its foundation, \\nincorporating innovative features like ChatPrompt Template, \\nHuman Message Prompt Template, Conversation Buffer \\nMemory, and LLMChain to proactively identify issues and \\ndeliver comprehensive assistance. In the next phase, we plan \\nto enhance this chatbot further by implementing Retrieval-\\nAugmented Generation (RAG) and incorporating embedding \\nvectors for frequently asked questions related to mental health. \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] K.

      "1. Context-Aware Capabilities: LangChain facilitates the \n",
      "development of applications that are inherently \n",
      "context-aware. This means that these applications can \n",
      "connect to a language model and draw from various \n",
      "sources of context, such as prompt instructions, a few-\n",
      "shot examples, or existing content, to ground their \n",
      "responses effectively. \n",
      "2. Reasoning Abilities: LangChain equips applications \n",
      "with the capacity to reason effectively. By relying on a \n",
      "language model, these applications can make informed \n",
      "decisions about how to respond based on the provided \n",
      "context and determine the appropriate actions to take. \n",
      "LangChain offers several key value propositions: \n",
      "Modular Components: It provides abstractions that \n",
      "simplify working with language models, along with a \n",
      "comprehensive collection of implementations for each \n",

      "ChatModels operate with a list of messages as input, \n",
      "generating a message as output. \n",
      "Each message in the list has two parts: the content and the \n",
      "role. The content is the actual text or substance of the message, \n",
      "while the role denotes the role or source of the message (such \n",
      "as \"User,\" \"Assistant,\" \"System,\" etc.). \n",
